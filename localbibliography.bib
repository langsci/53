  Abstract                 = {The early phases of syntactic acquisition are characterized by many input frequency and item effects, which argue against theories assuming innate access to classical syntactic categories. In formulating an alternative view, we consider both prototype and exemplar-learning models of categorization. We argue for a 'hybrid' usage-based view in which acquisition depends on exemplar learning and retention, out of which permanent abstract schemas gradually emerge and are immanent across the summed similarity of exemplar collections. These schemas are graded in strength depending on the number of exemplars and the degree to which semantic similarity is reinforced by phonological, lexical, and distributional similarity.},

A subset of spatial prepositions is chosen and an appropriate quantification is applied to each of them that capture their inherent qualitative properties. The quantifications use such object attributes as area, centers, and elongation properties. The familiar zeroth, first, and second order moments are used to characterize these attributes. The paper details how and why the particular quantifications were chosen. Since spatial prepositions are by their nature rather vague and dependent on context a technique for fuzzifying the definition of the spatial preposition is explained. Finally an example task is chosen to illustrate the appropriateness of the quantification techniques},

  Abstract                 = {We report an experiment designed to study whether models of human-human voice dialogues can be applied successfully to human-computer communication using natural spoken language. Two groups of six subjects were asked to obtain information about air travel via dialogue with a remote "travel agent". Subjects in the computer group were led to believe they were talking to a computer whereas subjects in the operator group were told they were talking to a human. Both groups of subjects actually talked to the same human experimenter. The study focuses on subjects' representations of interlocutor skill and knowledge, and differs from previous analogous studies in several respects: the task is more complex, giving rise to structured exchanges in natural language rather than to question/answer pairs in simplified language; specific attention has been paid to the design, which attempts to avoid biases that have flawed other studies (in particular, conditions are identical for both groups); the time factor has been taken into account (subjects take part in three sessions, at 1-week intervals).
Some results confirm those of the literature, namely that subjects of the computer group tend to control and simplify their use of language more than those in the operator group. However, most observations are either new or in contradiction with previous results: subjects in the computer group produce more utterances but no significant differences were observed with respect to most structural and pragmatic features of language; the time factor plays a dual role. Subjects in both groups tend to become more concise. Operator group strategies differ significantly across sessions as regards scenario processing (problem solving) whereas computer group strategies remain stable.
These differences in behavior between groups are ascribed to differences in representations of interlocutor ability.},

Is children's language acquisition based on innate linguistic structures or built from cognitive and communicative skills? This book summarises the major theoretical debates in all of the core domains of child language acquisition research (phonology, word-learning, inflectional morphology, syntax and binding) and includes a complete introduction to the two major contrasting theoretical approaches: generativist and constructivist. For each debate, the predictions of the competing accounts are closely and even-handedly evaluated against the empirical data. The result is an evidence-based review of the central issues in language acquisition research that will constitute a valuable resource for students, teachers, course-builders and researchers alike.

  Abstract                 = {The percussion is insistent. Dancers move in rows from the back of the hall towards the drummers at the front. From time to time, the mistress of the dance breaks the flow, and twice repeats a sequence of energetic dance moves. The dancers then move forward again, repeating her moves, more or less. Some do it well, others not so well.
Imitation involves, in part, seeing the instructor's dance as a set of familiar movements of shoulders, arms, hands, belly and legs. Many constituents are variants of familiar actions, rather than familiar actions themselves. Thus one must not only observe actions and their composition, but also novelties in the constituents and their variations. One must also perceive the overlapping and sequencing of all these moves and then remember the ``coordinated control program'' so constructed. Probably, memory and perception are intertwined.
As the dancers perform they both act out the recalled coordinated control program and tune it. By observing other dancers and synchronizing with their neighbors and the insistent percussion of the drummers, they achieve a collective representation that tunes their own, possibly departing from the instructor's original. At the same time, some dancers seem more or less skilled -- some will omit a movement, or simplify it, others may replace it with their imagined equivalent. (One example: the instructor alternates touching her breast and moving her arm outwards. Most dancers move their arms in and out with no particular target.) Other changes are matters of motor rather than perceptual or mnemonic skill -- not everyone can lean back as far as the instructor without losing balance.
These are the ingredients of imitation.},

These parallels mean that evolutionary biologists and historical linguists seek answers to similar questions and face similar problems. As a result, the theory and methodology of the two disciplines have evolved in remarkably similar ways. In addition to Darwin's curious parallels of process, there are a number of equally curious parallels and connections between the development of methods in biology and historical linguistics. Here we briefly review the parallels between biological and linguistic evolution and contrast the historical development of phylogenetic methods in the two disciplines. We then look at a number of recent studies that have applied phylogenetic methods to language data and outline some current problems shared by the two fields.

  Abstract                 = {This volume presents principles and models for describing language variation, and introduces a time-based, dynamic framework for linguistic description. The book first summarizes some of the problems of grammatical description encountered from Saussure through the present and then outlines possibilities for new descriptions of language which take into account sociolinguistic factors. For instance, a static framework would view creole situations as "freak" situations and creoles as necessarily unstable and rapidly changing. A dynamic framework would endorse the Saussurian paradox that competence is looked for exclusively in the individual, but variety is sought in society. A dynamic framework would hold that competence is polylectal; what language-users know about communicating with others more nearly represents their language competence than the subset of this knowledge exhibited in production. The bulk of the text centers around the enumeration of principles and the presentation of models for variation theory. A paper on feature marking and weighting is appended},

  Abstract                 = {To describe phenomena that occur at different time scales, computational models of the brain must incorporate different levels of abstraction. At time scales of approximately 1⁄3 of a second, orienting movements of the body play a crucial role in cognition and form a useful computational level -- more abstract than that used to capture natural phenomena but less abstract than what is traditionally used to study high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning. At this ``embodiment level,'' the constraints of the physical system determine the nature of cognitive operations. The key synergy is that at time scales of about 1⁄3 of a second, the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference called deictic in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs. This target article focuses on how deictic bindings make it possible to perform natural tasks. Deictic computation provides a mechanism for representing the essential features that link external sensory data with internal cognitive programs and motor actions. One of the central features of cognition, working memory, can be related to moment-by-moment dispositions of body features such as eye movements and hand movements.},

The Common Knowledge view assumes that symbolic conventions develop through the accumulation of common knowledge regarding communication practices among the members of a community. In contrast with this view, it is proposed that coordinated communication emerges a by-product of local interactions among dyads. A set of multi-agent computer simulations show that a population of ``egocentric'' agents can establish and maintain symbolic conventions without common knowledge. In the simulations, convergence to a single conventional system was most likely and most efficient when agents updated their behavior on the basis of local rather than global, system-level information. The massive feedback and parallelism present in the simulations gave rise to phenomena that are often assumed to result from complex strategic processing on the part of individual agents. The implications of these findings for the development of theories of language use are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robot- ics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstra- tion experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increas- ingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major per- spectives in cognitive science---classic symbolic architectures, statistical⁄dynamical systems, and grounded cognition---will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.},

  Abstract                 = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components -- not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the known animal communication systems, human languages appear to be unique in their use of recursively characterizable structural relations among sequences of sounds or gestures and the meanings those sequences can be used to express.
The patterns of structural relations that recursion makes possible can serve a range of communicative functions, tremendously extending the expressive resources of the system. Certain structural relations may be used to express specific meanings, or to modify, or extend, or restrict the meanings conveyed by words and other simple constituents.

Despite the unbounded complexity it makes possible, a recursive communicative system can be learned relatively easily because the constituents of a complex construction may themselves be simpler instances of that same kind of construction, and the properties of complex constructions are often predictable from simpler counterparts.

The research described in this paper is an investigation of how recursive communication systems can come to be. In particular, the investigation explores the possibility that such a system could emerge among the members of a population as the result of a process I characterize as ``negotiation,'' because each individual both contributes to, and conforms with, the system as it develops. The members of the population are assumed to possess general cognitive capacities sufficient for communicative behavior, and for learning to modify their behavior based on observations of others. However they are given no external guidance about how their communication system is to work, and their internal cognitive mechanisms impose few specific constraints.

Methods drawn from ontological engineering are suggested to be relevant both for the representations of these areas and for specifying the interrelationships between them. In addition, a characterisation of current ontologies involving space is given, clarifying why spatial language is particularly difficult to interpret. The article concludes with our own proposal for a general architecture for natural language spatial semantics capable of being used across diverse applications.

The ontological framework is based on our current work on ontology specification, where we are investigating Masolo et al.'s Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) extended particularly for space and navigation by incorporating aspects of Smith et al.'s Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). Our conclusion is that ontology should necessarily play an important role in the design and modelling of cognitive robotic systems: comparability between approaches is improved, modelling gaps and weaknesses are highlighted, re-use of existing formalisations is facilitated, and extensions for interaction with other components, such as natural language systems, are directly supported.},

We describe the general nature and features of this ontology and show how we have extended it for working particularly with space. Treaitng the semantics of natural language expressions concerning space in this way offers a substantial simplification of the general problem of relating natural spatial language to its contextualized interpretation. Example specifications based on natural language examples are presented, as well as an evaluation of the ontology's coverage, consistency, predictive power, and applicability.},

In the context of autonomous cognitive systems, the processes by which such concept functionality could be acquired would be particularly useful - indeed, a developmental account would obviate the need for the provision of explicit information or training supervision by the system designer. This paper seeks to explore this issue by applying a set of principles within a developmental framework that support a wide range of cognitive competencies to this problem, thus seeking to embed the development of concepts into a wider framework of cognitive processing. Comparison with a benchmark conceptual modelling system indicates that the proposed approach can account for a number of features, namely concept-based classification, and its extension to prototype-like functionality.},

  Abstract                 = {Language has a fundamentally social function. Processes of human interaction along with domain-general cognitive processes shape the structure and knowledge of language. Recent research in the cognitive sciences has demonstrated that patterns of use strongly affect how language is acquired, is used, and changes. These processes are not independent of one another but are facets of the same complex adaptive system (CAS). Language as a CAS involves the following key features: The system consists of multiple agents (the speakers in the speech community) interacting with one another.
The system is adaptive; that is, speakers' behavior is based on their past interactions, and current and past interactions together feed forward into future behavior. A speaker's behavior is the consequence of competing factors ranging from perceptual constraints to social motivations. The structures of language emerge from interrelated patterns of experience, social interaction, and cognitive mechanisms. The CAS approach reveals commonalities in many areas of language research, including first and second language acquisition, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, language evolution, and computational modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {In the evolution of language field a large body of work exists on mapping meaning to form, but little attention has been paid to the formation of meaning itself. Nevertheless, the debate on the nature of perceptually grounded concepts such as colour categories, and the impact of language on this, is central to cognitive science and linguistics. One point of view considers perceptual concepts as universal to all humans and argues that genetical determinism is responsible for this. Opponents adhere to a relativist account, which claims that concepts are learned and thus are ecologically and culturally specific.
Colour categorisation presents an opportunity for testing both perspectives. Berlin and Kay, in the late sixties, and Rosch, in the early seventies, provided convincing evidence for the universalist position through linguistic and memory experiments. Field data collected and interpreted over the last decades show a remarkable agreement between colour categories from different cultures. The relativist position, it is argued, is unable to account for these phenomena. Backed up by results from neuropsychology on the opponent character of colour perception the universalist stance has held strongly. Only recently, evidence from anthropology and close scrutiny of experimental results and the deductions based on these undermine the authority of the universalist model. The question arises if the relativist position can account for the strong facts brought forward by experimental data.
This work investigates outstanding issues in the colour categorisation debate using computational modelling. It reports new insights on the plausibility of accounts of the origins of colour categories. Four simulations have been constructed, two in which colour categories are evolved through a process of natural selection, the other two in which colour categories are formed with a learning approach using environmental, ecological and cultural constraints. Both genetic evolution and learning are studied with and without the influence of language.
The basic entity of the simulations is the agent. The colour perception of an agent is modelled as a mapping from spectral measurements to an internal three-dimensional colour space. Categories are defined on this internal space as adaptive network. These adaptive networks consist of locally tuned receptors sensitive to small region in the space. The output of a network is the weighted sum of the reactions of all its locally tuned receptors. Categories can also be associated with words, needed for communicating colour meaning to other agents. The association between a category and a word is modelled by a scalar value representing the strength of the association.
Four simulations have been implemented; (1) agents learn categories individually under the influence of environmental and ecological constraints, (2) agents acquire categories through cultural learning, where agents use language to learn the colour categories, (3) agents genetically evolve categories with selection happening on the ability of the agents to discriminate colour stimuli, and (4) agents genetically evolve categories with selection happening on the communicative abilities of the agents.
The categorical repertoires of an agent in simulations (1) and (3) are judged on a discrimination task, in which an individual has to discriminate one colour stimulus from a set of other colour stimuli. The repertoires of agent in simulations (2) and (4) are judged on their performance on a communication task. This communication task is evaluated with two agents: one agent has to name one colour from a set of colours and the second agent has to guess what colour the first agent meant.
The results show how genetic evolution and learning are both able to come up with a set of colour categories satisfying the discrimination task. Also genetic evolution and cultural learning arrive at colour categories shared throughout the population. The evolutionary approach arrives at identical categories because evolved individuals are all offspring of a few fit ancestors and thus all agents share the same ``colour genes''. On the other hand, a population using cultural learning also reaches shared colour categories; not because the categories are genetically passed on, but because the linguistic interactions push the agents towards having similar categorical repertoires needed for communication. So this shows how individuals can reach coherent categories by way of an indirect coupling through the environment. The linguistic task boosts the conceptual coherence, showing a causal influence of language on category acquisition. We argue that an adaptive model together with a shared ecology and linguistic sharing of category labels provides a viable explanation for sharedness of colour categories, dispensing the need for a universalist account.},

Many scholars have explained this universal character as being the result of an innate representation or an innate developmental program which all humans share. We will critically assess the available evidence, which is at best controversial, and we will suggest an alternative account for the universality of color categories based on linguistic transmission constrained by universal biases. We introduce a computational model to test our hypothesis and present results. These show that indeed the cultural acquisition of color categories together with mild constraints on the perception and categorical representation result in categories that have a distribution similar to human color categories.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of how young learners acquire the meaning of words is fundamental to language development and cognition. A host of computational models exist which demonstrate various mechanisms in which words and their meanings can be transferred between a teacher and learner. However these models often assume that the learner can easily distinguish between the referents of words, and do not show if the learning mechanisms still function when there is perceptual ambiguity about the referent of a word. This paper presents two models that acquire meaning-word mappings in a continuous semantic space. The first model is a cross-situational learning model in which the learner induces word-meaning mappings through statistical learning from repeated exposures. The second model is a social model, in which the learner and teacher engage in a dyadic learning interaction to transfer word-meaning mappings. We show how cross-situational learning, despite there being no information to the learner as to the exact referent of a word during learning, still can learn successfully. However, social learning outperforms cross-situational strategies both in speed of acquisition and performance. The results suggest that cross-situational learning is efficient for situations where referential ambiguity is limited, but in more complex situations social learning is the more optimal strategy.},

Our approach is basedd on the assumption that participants try to use as little effort as possible when referring to objects. This assumption and a particular choice of features to be included in a referential expression. We claim that both factors help in reducing efoort needed to, on the one hand, refer to an object and, on the other hand, to identify it. As a result of the focus of attention the number of potential target objects (i.e, the object the speaker intends to refer to) is reduced. The choice of a specific type of feature determines the number of objects that have to be identified in order to be able to understand the referential expression. An empirical study was conducted in which pairs of of participants cooperatively carried out a simple block-building task, and the results procided empirical evidence that supported the aforementioned claims. Especially the focus of attention turned out to play an important role in reducing the total effort.},

  Abstract                 = {It is hypothesized that creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

  Abstract                 = {Social behaviour and in particular social learning are key mechanisms for the cohesion and evolution of primate societies. Similarly, social skills might be desirable for artificial agents who are expected to interact with other natural or artificial agents. We view learning, communication and imitation as important capabilities to possess by social artificial agents and study how these skills can be designed and used by physically embodied autonomous robots. We study grounding and use of communication among heterogeneous agents. In particular, we investigate the role of social interactions for sharing of context and building of joint attention among communicative agents. Grounding and use of communication is investigated through simulations within a group of autonomous agents. Results show that social behaviour benefit the agents in two circumstances: (1) agents capable of following one another, and in this way imitating each other's movements, develop faster and better a common understanding of the language; (2) furthermore, the agents' capability of communicating with one another via a common vocabulary benefits to the group and to each agent individually as it speeds up the transmission of information. We use a connectionist model, based on Hebbian associative learning, for the learning of the word-signal pairs. This work follows robotic experiments [6, 5, 7] in which a physical autonomous robot was taught a vocabulary to describe its perceptions of objects, movement, inclination and orientation. The robot was taught either by a human instructor or by another robot. The teacher-learner robot experiments were based on an imitative strategy whereby the learner robot followed the teacher robot. The work of this paper demonstrates scaling up of this movement imitative strategy for transmitting a vocabulary across a group of robotic agents, i.e. from a teacher agent to several learner agents. In particular, it shows that imitative behaviour is necessary for the grounding of the agents' proprioceptions and speeds up the grounding of exteroceptions. These studies stress the importance of behavioural social mechanisms in addition to general cognitive abilities of associativity for grounding communication in embodied agents. In particular, it shows that a simple movement imitation strategy is an interesting scenario for the transmission of a language, as it is an easy means of getting the agents to share a common context of perceptions, which is a prerequisite for a common understanding of the language to develop. It is thus suggested that a behaviour-oriented approach might be more appropriate than a pure cognitivist one which is dominating in related studies of the mechanisms involved in grounding communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Although languages around the world display an overwhelming variety in ways to describe colours, most of the research in the domain of colour has focussed on the use of single colour terms. This approach has allowed researchers in a wide range of fields to tackle interesting questions, such as the extent to which colour categories are innate or learned. In the field of artificial language evolution, the focus on single colour terms has enabled researchers to build computational models in which populations of linguistic agents can construct and coordinate their own colour category system so that they become successful in communication.
A few descriptive studies report on describing colours beyond the restriction of using a single colour term. The results of these studies seem conclusive: only a small minority (around 15%) of all colour samples would be described using a single colour term. Most samples are described using more elaborate expressions, for example by using modifiers or combinations of colour terms.
In this thesis, I show how the current models in artificial language evolution can be extended to allow for richer descriptions of colour samples. In order to do so, I deploy two powerful formalisms that have been developed to support this kind of experiments: Incremental Recruitment Language (IRL) to represent the semantics, or meaning, of linguistic utterances and Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) to transform these meanings into linguistic utterances and back.
Four different language strategies are explored: the basic colour strategy (``blue''), the graded membership strategy (``greenish''), the category combination strategy (``blue-green'') and the basic modification strategy (``dark blue''). Each of these strategies is realised in different languages around the world and some studies reported on the most prototypical colour samples that are associated with these expressions. For each strategy, I propose a semantic template which captures the general cognitive operations required to use that particular strategy and syntactic templates which represent general grammatical rules that can express semantic templates in language. I pursue a compositional approach, focussing on the re-use of semantic primitives and syntactic templates as much as possible. I show that more complicated language strategies can be conceived as minor extensions of the basic colour strategy and that only a few syntactic templates suffice to express all these strategies. Once these strategies have been operationalised, I compare their naming behaviour to human data reported in literature. The performance of the strategies can be compared in a baseline experiment in which simulated language users engage in linguistic interactions of which the difficulty is carefully controlled.
The implementation of a language strategy can be completed by adding learning operators which allow an agent to pick up the language system of another agent and to extend the current language system whenever the communicative need arises. The performance of these operators is tested in an acquisition and a formation experiment. In an acquisition experiment, one agent knows a predefined language system and acts as a teacher. The goal of the learner agent is to acquire the predefined language system and to become as successful in communication as two agents which share perfect knowledge of the predefined language system. In a formation experiment, a population of agents needs to invent and coordinate their own language system based on a particular language strategy. I present results for both the basic colour strategy and the graded membership strategy.
Once the implementation of a language strategy is completed, in-depth studies can be carried out. I show the results of three different studies using the basic colour strategy: (a) the positive impact of the statistical distribution of colours in the environment on the similarity between simulated and human basic colour systems (b) the coordinating role of language on simulated language systems and the positive impact of language on the similarity between simulated and human basic colour systems (c) the impact of embodiment on the performance of different learning operators. In embodied experiments, two robots perceive a shared environment through their vision systems. Although this introduces a certain level of noise as both robots perceive the world from a different perspective, the data contains a high level of structure as it is based on the colours of the objects presented to the robots. Overall, embodiment has a positive effect on the performance of the proposed learning operators.
In the history of a language, a competition between two strategies on how to express a particular domain might arise. In the domain of colour, this has been observed in a vast number of languages which shift from being brightness based to being hue based. The colour term ``yellow'' used to reflect the meaning ``to shine'' in Old English but shifted to a hue sense in Middle English and could be used to refer to the colour of yolk or discoloured paper. I present a model in which a population of agents successfully aligns on which language strategy they use based on linguistic interactions. I show that this model is capable of reproducing the meaning shifts similar to those reported in literature.
Finally, I address some questions on the origins of new language strategies. New semantic templates can be generated through a combinatorial search process in which semantic primitives are combined to form complex semantic templates. I show that each of the proposed language strategies for the domain of colour can be the outcome of such a search process. The syntactic templates that have been introduced to express these templates in language, can be incorporated in repair strategies which allow agents to invent, acquire and align their own set of grammatical rules. I demonstrate how these repair strategies allow a population of agents to form their own hierarchical language that includes some recursive rules. These recursive rules have the benefit of being able to express more complex meaning without the cost of alignment in the population.
Even though the examples in this thesis are limited to the domain of colour, the proposed templates can easily be extended to richer examples and deployed in other continuous domains. The proposed transformation processes could be used to name the colours of concepts that vary in colour, like for example the colours used to describe wine. Other possible domains include the spatial domain, in which spatial categories, such as near and far, also exhibit properties of graded membership which can be made explicit in language (eg. ``very near''). The results reported in this thesis should hence not be thought of as a final result but rather as in interesting starting point for a whole line of research in the origins and evolution of natural languages.},

Through a series of such games, a colour lexicon can be developed that is sufficiently shared to allow for successful communication, even when the agents start out without any predefined categories. In previous models of colour naming games, the shared context was typically artificially generated from a set of colour stimuli and both agents in the interaction perceive this environment in an identical way. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the colour naming game in a robotic setup in which humanoid robots perceive a set of colourful objects from their own perspective. We compare the resulting colour ontologies to those found in human languages and show how these ontologies reflect the environment in which they were developed.},

We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible.

  Abstract                 = {The Graphplan planner has enjoyed considerable success as a planning algorithm for classical STRIPS domains. In this paper we explore the extent to which its representation can be used for probabilistic planning. In particular, we consider an MDP-style framework in which the state of the world is known but actions are probabilistic, and the objective is to produce a finite horizon contingent plan with highest probability of success within the horizon.
We describe two extensions of Graphplan in this direction. The first, PGraphplan, produces an optimal contingent plan. It typically suffers a performance hit compared to Graphplan but still appears to be fast compared with other approaches to probabilistic planning problems. The second, TGraphplan, runs at essentially the same speed as Graphplan, but produces potentially sub-optimal policies: TGraphplan's policy selects the first action on the highest probability trajectory from its current state to the goal. Ideally, we would like an optimal planner for probabilistic domains with the same speed that Graphplan would have if the domain were made deterministic. By comparing the speed and quality of these two planners to each other and to other existing planners, we are able to estimate how far off we are from our ideal.
PGraphplan is based on a forward-chaining search, unlike the backward-chaining search of the standard Graphplan algorithm. Thus, one focus of this paper is exploring the extent to which Graphplan's representation can be used to speed up forward search in addition to the backward search for which it was originally intended.},

  Abstract                 = {While rules and exemplars are usually viewed as opposites, this paper argues that they form end points of the same distribution. By representing both rules and exemplars as (partial) trees, we can take into account the fluid middle ground between the two extremes. This insight is the starting point for a new theory of language learning that is based on the following idea: If a language learner does not know which phrase-structure trees should be assigned to initial sentences, s ⁄ he allows (implicitly) for all possible trees and lets linguistic experience decide which is the ``best'' tree for each sentence. The best tree is obtained by maximizing ``structural analogy'' between a sentence and previous sentences, which is formalized by the most probable shortest combination of subtrees from all trees of previous sentences. Corpus-based experiments with this model on the Penn Treebank and the Childes database indicate that it can learn both exemplar-based and rule-based aspects of language, ranging from phrasal verbs to auxiliary fronting. By having learned the syntactic structures of sentences, we have also learned the grammar implicit in these structures, which can in turn be used to produce new sentences. We show that our model mimicks children's language development from item-based constructions to abstract constructions, and that the model can simulate some of the errors made by children in producing complex questions.},

  Abstract                 = {The research described in this thesis tries to explain the origins and the structure of human sound systems (and more specifically human vowel systems) as the result of self organisation in a population under functional con straints. These constraints are: acoustic distinctiveness, articulatory ease and ease of learning. The process is modelled with computer simulations, following the methodology of artificial life and artificial intelligence. The research is part of a larger research effort into understanding the origins and the nature of language and intelli- gence.
The emergence of sound systems is studied in a setting called the imitation game. In an imitation game, agents from a population interact in order to imitate each other as well as possible. Imitation is a binary process: it is either successful or a failure. Agents are able to produce and perceive speech sounds in a human like way, and to adapt and extend their repertoires of speech sounds in reaction to the outcome of the imitation games. The agents' vowel repertoires are initially empty and are bootstrapped by random insertion of a speech sound when an agent with an empty repertoire wants to produce a sound. When the agents' repertoires are not empty anymore, random insertion does not happen anymore, except with very low probability. This low probability random insertion is done in order to keep a pres sure on the agents to extend their number of vowels. .

As the agents' repertoires are initially empty and their production and percep tion are not biased towards any language in particular, the systems of speech sounds that emerge are language independent and can be considered predictions of the kinds of systems of speech sounds that can be found in human languages.

The main focus of the thesis is on the emergence of vowel systems. It is shown that coherent, successful and realistic vowel systems emerge for a wide range of pa rameter settings in the simulation. When the vowel systems are compared with the types of vowel systems that are found in human languages, remarkable similarities are found. Not only are the most frequently found human vowel systems predicted, (this could already be done with direct optimisation of acoustic distinctiveness) but also less frequently occurring vowel systems are predicted in approximately the right proportions.

Variations on the basic imitation game show that it is remarkably robust. Not only do coherent, successful and realistic vowel systems emerge for a large number of parameter settings, but they also emerge when either the imitation game or the agents are changed qualitatively. Coherent and realistic systems still emerge when the perception and production of the agents are changed. Even if the rules of the imitation game are slightly changed, coherent and realistic systems still emerge. Of course, there are circumstances under which no systems emerge, indicating that the process is non trivial.

It is also shown that the vowel systems can emerge and be preserved in chang ing populations. When old agents are removed from the population, and new, empty agents are added, coherent and realistic vowel systems can still emerge, provided that the replacement rate is not too high. It is also shown in the thesis that vowel systems can be preserved in a population, even though all original agents in it have been replaced. Furthermore, it is shown that under certain circumstances it can be advantegeous to have an age structure in the population, so that older agents learn less quickly than young ones.

Finally, some experiments with more complex utterances are presented in the thesis. An experiment with artificial CV syllables is presented and it is shown that, although phonemically coded (as opposed to holistically coded) systems can emerge, this simulation is much harder and much more sensitive to parameter changes than the vowel simulation. This probably has to do with the fact that in the case of CV syllables multiple independent and partly contradictory constraints have to be satis fied simultaneously, whereas in the vowel simulations, only one constraint (acoustic distinctiveness) is really important. Also, the first attempts at building a system that can produce complex and dynamic utterances without any constraints on their structure are presented, and it is argued that the main obstacle to getting such a system to work is the mapping from acoustic signals back to articulatory com mands.

The conclusion of the thesis is that universal tendencies of human vowel systems, and probably of human sound systems in general can be explained as the re sult of self organisation in a population of agents that try to communicate as well as possible under articulatory and acoustic constraints. The articulatory and acoustic constraints cause the emerging sound systems to tend towards articulatory and acoustic optimality. However, the fact that the agents communicate in a population forces them to conform to the sound system in the population and causes sub- optimal systems to emerge as well.},

  Abstract                 = {In the AIPS98 Planning Contest, the HSP planner showed that heuristic search planners can be competitive with state-of-the-art Graphplan and SAT planners. Heuristic search planners like HSP transform planning problems into problems of heuristic search by automatically extracting heuristics from Strips encodings. They differ from specialized problem solvers such as those developed for the 24-Puzzle and Rubik's Cube in that they use a general declarative language for stating problems and a general mechanism for extracting heuristics from these representations.
In this paper, we study a family of heuristic search planners that are based on a simple and general heuristic that assumes that action preconditions are independent. The heuristic is then used in the context of best-first and hill-climbing search algorithms, and is tested over a large collection of domains. We then consider variations and extensions such as reversing the direction of the search for speeding node evaluation, and extracting information about propositional invariants for avoiding dead-ends. We analyze the resulting planners, evaluate their performance, and explain when they do best. We also compare the performance of these planners with two state-of-the-art planners, and show that the simplest planner based on a pure best-first search yields the most solid performance over a large set of problems. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach, establish a correspondence between heuristic search planning and Graphplan, and briefly survey recent ideas that can reduce the current gap in performance between general heuristic search planners and specialized solvers.},

representations suitable for performing inferences, in the service of understanding human language

and inference point of view. But even if one makes the choice of first-order logic as representation language, this is not enough: the computational semanticist needs to make further decisions
on how to model events, tense, modal contexts, anaphora and plural entities. Semantic representations are usually built on top of a syntactic analysis, using unification, techniques from the
lambda-calculus or linear logic, to do the book-keeping of variable naming. Inference has many
potential applications in computational semantics. One way to implement inference is using algorithms from automated deduction dedicated to first-order logic, such as theorem proving and
model building. Theorem proving can help in finding contradictions or checking for new information. Finite model building can be seen as a complementary inference task to theorem proving,
and it often makes sense to use both procedures in parallel. The models produced by model
generators for texts not only show that the text is contradiction-free; they also can be used
for disambiguation tasks and linking interpretation with the real world. To make interesting
inferences, often additional background knowledge is required (not expressed in the analysed
text or speech parts). This can be derived (and turned into first-order logic) from raw text, semistructured databases or large-scale lexical databases such as WordNet. Promising future research
directions of computational semantics are investigating alternative representation and inference
methods (using weaker variants of first-order logic, reasoning with defaults), and d},

The challenge of modeling this connection is to ground language at the level of relations. This type of grounding enables us to create high-level plans based on language abstractions. Our model jointly learns to predict precondition relations from text and to perform high-level planning guided by those relations. We implement this idea in the reinforcement learning framework using feedback automatically obtained from plan execution attempts. When applied to a complex virtual world and text describing that world, our relation extraction technique performs on par with a supervised baseline, yielding an F-measure of 66% compared to the baseline's 65%. Additionally, we show that a high-level planner utilizing these extracted relations significantly outperforms a strong, text unaware baseline -- successfully completing 80% of planning tasks as compared to 69% for the baseline.},

Pairs of speakers took it in turns to describe pictures to each other. One speaker was a confederate of the experimenter and produced scripted descriptions that systematically varied in syntactic structure. The syntactic structure of the confederate's description affected the syntactic structure of the other speaker's subsequent description. We suggest that these effects are instances of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986), and provide evidence for a shared level of representation in comprehension and production. We describe how these effects might be realized in a processing model of language production, and relate them to previous {\textregistered}ndings of linguistic co-ordination in dialogue.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to behave intelligently, artificial agents must be able to deliberatively plan their future actions. Unfortunately, realistic agent environments are usually highly dynamic and only partially observable, which makes planning computationally hard. For most practical purposes this rules out planning techniques that account for all possible contingencies in the planning process. However, many agent environments permit an alternative approach, namely continual planning, i.e. the interleaving of planning with acting and sensing. This paper presents a new principled approach to continual planning that describes why and when an agent should switch between planning and acting. The resulting continual planning algorithm enables agents to deliberately postpone parts of their planning process and instead actively gather missing information that is relevant for the later refinement of the plan. To this end, the algorithm explictly reasons about the knowledge (or lack thereof) of an agent and its sensory capabilities. These concepts are modelled in the planning language (MAPL). Since in many environments the major reason for dynamism is the behaviour of other agents, MAPL can also model multiagent environments, common knowledge among agents, and communicative actions between them. For Continual Planning, MAPL introduces the concept of of assertions, abstract actions that substitute yet unformed subplans. To evaluate our continual planning approach empirically we have developed MAPSIM, a simulation environment that automatically builds multiagent simulations from formal MAPL domains. Thus, agents can not only plan, but also execute their plans, perceive their environment, and interact with each other. Our experiments show that, using continual planning techniques, deliberate action planning can be used efficiently even in complex multiagent environments.},

According to this view language codes cultural information and as such forms the basis for the evolution of complexity in human culture. In this article we develop the theory that language also codes information in another sense: languages code information on their own structure. As a result, languages themselves provide information that influences their own survival. To understand the consequences of this theory we discuss recent computational models of linguistic evolution. Linguistic evolution is the process by which languages themselves evolve. This article draws together this recent work on linguistic evolution and highlights the significance of this process in understanding the evolution of linguistic complexity. Our conclusions are that: (1) the process of linguistic transmission constitutes the basis for an evolutionary system, and (2), that this evolutionary system is only superficially comparable to the process of biological evolution.},

I then examine the local place names, discuss their semantic and morphosyntactic properties, and relate them to the landscape vocabulary, to spatial vocabulary, and also to cultural narratives about events associated with particular places. I conclude with some observations on the determinants of landscape and place terminology in Tzeltal, and what this vocabulary and how it is used reveal about the conceptualization of landscape and places.},

  Abstract                 = {Language demonstrates structure while also showing considerable variation at all levels: languages differ from one another while still being shaped by the same principles; utterances within a language differ from one another while exhibiting the same structural patterns; languages change over time, but in fairly regular ways. This book focuses on the dynamic processes that create languages and give them their structure and variance. It outlines a theory of language that addresses the nature of grammar, taking into account its variance and gradience, and seeks explanation in terms of the recurrent processes that operate in language use. The evidence is based on the study of large corpora of spoken and written language, what we know about how languages change, as well as the results of experiments with language users. The result is an integrated theory of language use and language change which has implications for cognitive processing and language evolution.



[book review by Damaris N{\"u}bling]
This book summarizes several decades of functional-typological and cognitive linguistics and makes the case for a usage-based approach. It deals with the most important factors of language change and language structure. The findings are based on corpora, on experiments and on synchronic and diachronic data. This triangle forms an extremely promising pre-condition to truly understanding and explaining language change and, as a result, language structure. It is thus opposed to the attempts of OT which, at most, neatly describes language structures and tries to `explain' language change as the re-ranking of constraints. One of the most important topics concerning the causes of linguistic change are chunking phenomena which are the effect of frequent repetition of syntagmatic units: morphemes, lexical words, phrases, constructions, so-called prefab(rication)s. These prefabs gain high degrees of autonomy and tend to undergo special phonetic reductions as well as morphosyntactic and semantic changes. Phonetic reduction can even be accelerated by the expansion of the most frequent phonetic exemplar reductions of a certain context into other phonetic contexts where this form of reduction would less likely occur. At the same time, semantic compositionality and analysability decrease and facilitate direct access to the whole word complex which furthermore undergoes pragmatic shifts and strengthenings inferred by the context. Thus, not only semantic bleaching takes place, as often assumed, because the context plays a very important role. If these three mechanisms co-occur (which does not happen obligatorily), grammaticalization takes place.

Most of the chapters are devoted to grammaticalization phenomena taken from English, sometimes from Spanish, as, for example, the English future, the English auxiliaries, especially can. Most fruitful from the perspective of historical linguistics is the rise of constructions such as the Spanish quedarse / ponerse / hacerse / volverse + adjective-constructions or English drive someone crazy which show that the most frequent contexts produce the prototypical meaning of the whole construction which then becomes productive by attracting analogically other similar items (increase in type frequency). Many synchronic and diachronic data are provided, i.e., everything is demonstrated by linguistic examples and cor- pus results. This facilitates the understanding of the complex correlations. Most of the case studies are known from previous studies of Joan Bybee and colleagues. However, some minor questions remain, e.g., it is not really clear how different inflectional forms which became homophonous by phonological change should be treated. This happened with the old subjunctive which today occurs in conditional sentences (if your animal needed treatment, it would be done by the private vets). Today, it looks like a past tense form and even is identified with it by postulating that one and the same morpheme gained two disjoint meanings. In contrast, the development of the polysemy of will which emerged by grammaticalization is a completely different case.

Altogether, this is a very insightful and informative book which provides a good overview of Bybee's impressive investigations und which always integrates the diachronic perspective. Thus, I fully agree with the insight, that ``[a] linguistic theory is not complete if it does not embrace the contribution of language change to the understanding of language structure'' (p. 119).

A research perspective that takes language use into account opens up new views of old issues and provides an understanding of issues that linguists have rarely addressed. Referencing new developments in cognitive and functional linguistics, phonetics, and connectionist modeling, this book investigates various ways in which a speaker/hearer's experience with language affects the representation of phonology. Rather than assuming phonological representations in terms of phonemes, Joan Bybee adopts an exemplar model, in which specific tokens of use are stored and categorized phonetically with reference to variables in the context. This model allows an account of phonetically gradual sound change which produces lexical variation, and provides an explanatory account of the fact that many reductive sound changes affect high frequency items first. The well-known effects of type and token frequency on morphologically-conditioned phonological alterations are shown also to apply to larger sequences, such as fixed phrases and constructions, solving some of the problems formulated previously as dealing with the phonology-syntax interface.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract~~When confronted with uncertain or incomplete information in decision-making situations, monkeys and apes opt for either escaping the situation or seeking additional information. These responses have been interpreted as evidence of metacognitive abilities. However, this interpretation has been challenged. On the one hand, studies using the information-seeking paradigm have been criticized because subjects may simply engage in a search for information routine (e.g., search until spot the reward) without any metacognitive involvement. On the other hand, studies using the escape response paradigm have been criticized because subjects may not recognize their own state of uncertainty but have learned to use the escape response in the presence of certain stimuli configurations that create uncertainty. The current study attempted to address these two criticisms by presenting great apes (seven gorillas, eight chimpanzees, four bonobos, seven orangutans) with a seeking information task whose basic procedure consisted of presenting two hollow tubes, baiting one of them and letting subjects choose. Conditions varied depending on whether subjects had visual access to the baiting, the cost associated with seeking information, the time interval between baiting and choosing, the food quality and the additional information offered regarding the food's location. Although subjects showed a high retrieval accuracy when they had witnessed the baiting, they were more likely to check inside the tube before choosing when high stakes were involved (Experiment 3) or after a longer period of time had elapsed between the baiting and the retrieval of the reward (Experiment 2). In contrast, providing subjects with indirect auditory information about the food's location or increasing the cost of checking reduced checking before choosing (Experiment 1). Taken together, these findings suggest that subjects knew that they could be wrong when choosing. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new connectionist model of spatial language based on real psycholinguistic data. It puts together various constraints on object knowledge (``what'') and on object localisation (``where'') in order to influence the comprehension of a range of linguistic terms, mirroring what participants do in experiments. The computational model consists of a vision processing module for input scenes, an Elman network module for the representation of object dynamics, and a dual-route network for the production of object names and linguistic prepositions describing the scene. Preliminary simulations on the prediction of spatial term ratings are presented, and extensions of the model to vague quantifiers and other syntactic categories are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Using neural nets to simulate learning and the genetic algorithm to simulate evolution in a toy world of mushrooms and mushroom-foragers, we place two ways of acquiring categories into direct competition with one another: In (1) "sensorimotor toil,'' new categories are acquired through real-time, feedback- corrected, trial and error experience in sorting them. In (2) "symbolic theft,'' new categories are acquired by hearsay from propositions -- boolean combinations of symbols describing them. In competition, symbolic theft always beats sensorimotor toil. We hypothesize that this is the basis of the adaptive advantage of language. Entry-level categories must still be learned by toil, however, to avoid an infinite regress (the ``symbol grounding problem''). Changes in the internal representations of categories must take place during the course of learning by toil. These changes can be analyzed in terms of the compression of within-category similarities and the expansion of between-category differences. These allow regions of similarity space to be separated, bounded and named, and then the names can be combined and recombined to describe new categories, grounded recursively in the old ones. Such compression/expansion effects, called "categorical perception" (CP), have previously been reported with categories acquired by sensorimotor toil; we show that they can also arise from symbolic theft alone. The picture of natural language and its origins that emerges from this analysis is that of a powerful hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor capacity, infinitely superior to its purely sensorimotor precursors, but still grounded in and dependent on them. It can spare us from untold time and effort learning things the hard way, through direct experience, but it remain anchored in and translatable into the language of experience.},

This in turn will benefit the design of cognitive robots capable of learning to handle and manipulate objects and tools autonomously, to cooperate and communicate with other robots and humans, and to adapt their abilities to changing internal, environmental, and social conditions. Four key areas of research challenges are discussed, specifically for the issues related to the understanding of: 1) how agents learn and represent compositional actions; 2) how agents learn and represent compositional lexica; 3) the dynamics of social interaction and learning; and 4) how compositional action and language representations are integrated to bootstrap the cognitive system. The review of specific issues and progress in these areas is then translated into a practical roadmap based on a series of milestones. These milestones provide a possible set of cognitive robotics goals and test scenarios, thus acting as a research roadmap for future work on cognitive developmental robotics.},

We present simulations in which populations of neural networks living in an environment evolve a simple language with an informative function. Signals are produced to help other individuals to categorize edible and poisonous mushrooms in order to decide whether to approach or avoid encountered mushrooms. Language production, while not under direct evolutionary pressure, evolves as a by-product of the independently evolving perceptual ability to categorize mushrooms.},

The robot model is based on an integrative vision of language, in which linguistic abilities are strictly dependent on, and grounded in, other behaviors and skills. It uses simulated robots that learn through imitation the names of basic actions. Robots also learn higher-order action concepts through the process of grounding transfer. The simulation demonstrates how new, higher-order behavioral abilities can be autonomously built upon previously-grounded basic action categories, following linguistic interaction with human users.},

  Abstract                 = {Reference frames are representations that parse space. In the case of spatial terms, reference frames mediate the mapping of linguistic expressions onto spatial configurations of objects. In the sentence ``The fly is above the cat,'' ``above'' is defined with respect to a reference frame that is imposed on the cat. Different types of reference frames can be used to define spatial terms, each based on a different source of information. For example, gravity, the orientation of objects in the scene or the orientation of the viewer can all be used to set the orientation of a reference frame. When these reference frames disagree (because the viewer is reclining or because the objects in the scene are overturned), there are competing definitions for the spatial term, resulting in the need for reference frame selection. The purpose of this paper is to review a line of research that examines reference frame selection in the context of spatial language. This work shows that all reference frames are initially active and assign a direction to a spatial term. Moreover, this activation is automatic, and is followed by the selection of a single reference frame, with selection accompanied by inhibition of the non- selected frames. Parallels between reference frame selection in language and in perception and attention are discussed.},

Spatial templates are applied to reference frames and define regions in space that correspond to good, acceptable, and bad uses of particular spatial relations. In two experiments we examined whether reference frame selection influences the spatial templates that are constructed for the spatial relations ``above'' and ``below.'' Results indicated two such influences, one operating across trials and one operating within a trial. Across trials, the preferences for using the different types of reference frames directly influenced the parsing of space, such that when multiple spatial templates were constructed, they were combined to form a composite template. Spatial templates constructed for the different reference frames were very similar, indicating that the type of reference frame did not alter the overall shape or relative sizes of the regions within the spatial template. Within a trial, the activation of multiple reference frames during reference frame selection resulted in the construction of multiple spatial templates, even when instructions were given to respond on the basis of a single reference frame},

These behaviors have mostly been studied separately. In the current study, we investigated the most important of these behaviors together as they emerged in a single group of 24 infants between 9 and 15 months of age. At each of seven monthly visits, we measured joint attentional engagement, gaze and point following, imitation of two dif- ferent kinds of actions on objects, imperative and declarative gestures, and comprehension and production of language. We also measured several non-social-cognitive skills as a point of comparison. We report two studies. The focus of the first study was the initial emergence of infants' social-cognitive skills and how these skills are related to one another developmentally. We found a reliable pattern of emergence: Infants progressed from sharing to following to directingothers' attention and behavior. The nonsocial skills did not emerge predictably in this developmental sequence. Furthermore, correlational analyses showed that the ages of emergence of all pairs of the social-cognitive skills or their components were interrelated. The focus of the second study was the social interaction of infants and their mothers, especially with regard to their skills of joint attentional engagement (including mothers' use of language to follow into or direct in- fants' attention) and how these skills related to infants' early communicative competence. Our measures of communicative competence included not only language production, as in previous studies, but also language comprehension and gesture production. It was found that two measures-the amount of time infants spent in joint engagement with their mothers and the degree to which mothers used language that followed into their infant's focus of
attention-predicted infants' earliest skills of gestural and linguistic communication. Results of the two studies are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of social-cognitive development, for theories of language develop- ment, and for theories of the process by means of which human children become fully participating members of the cultural activities and processes into which they are born.},

  Abstract                 = {Linguistic adaptation is a phenomenon where language representations change in response to lin- guistic input. Adaptation can occur on multiple linguistic levels such as phonology (tuning of pho- notactic constraints), words (repetition priming), and syntax (structural priming). The persistent nature of these adaptations suggests that they may be a form of implicit learning and connectionist models have been developed which instantiate this hypothesis. Research on implicit learning, however, has also produced evidence that explicit chunk knowledge is involved in the perfor- mance of these tasks. In this review, we examine how these interacting implicit and explicit processes may change our understanding of language learning and processing.},

This is one of the facets of the general problem of integrating symbolic and non-symbolic processes in an intelligent system. G{\"a}rdenfors' conceptual spaces provide a geometric treatment of knowledge which bridges the gap between the symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches. As such, they can be used for the study of the anchoring problem. In this paper, we propose a computational framework for anchoring based on conceptual spaces. Our framework exploits the geometric structure of conceptual spaces for many of the crucial tasks of anchoring, like matching percepts to symbolic descriptions or tracking the evolution of objects over time.},

We demonstrate its capabilities by developing a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games in both English and Korean without any language-specific prior knowledge. Training employs only ambiguous supervision consisting of a stream of descriptive textual comments and a sequence of events extracted from the simulation trace. The system simultaneously establishes correspondences between individual comments and the events that they describe while building a translation model that supports both parsing and generation. We also present a novel algorithm for learning which events are worth describing. Human evaluations of the generated commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality and in some cases even on par with those produced by humans for our limited domain.},

  Abstract                 = {A growing body of evidence in cognitive science and neuroscience points towards the existence of a deep interconnection between cognition, perception and action. According to this embodied perspective language is grounded in the sensorimotor system and language understanding is based on a mental simulation process (Jeannerod, 2007; Gallese, 2008; Barsalou, 2009). This means that during action words and sentence comprehension the same perception, action, and emotion mechanisms implied during interaction with objects are recruited. Among the neural underpinnings of this simulation process an important role is played by a sensorimotor matching system known as the mirror neuron system (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). Despite a growing number of studies, the precise dynamics underlying the relation between language and action are not yet well understood. In fact, experimental studies are not always coherent as some report that language processing interferes with action execution while others find facilitation. In this work we present a detailed neural network model capable of reproducing experimentally observed influences of the processing of action-related sentences on the execution of motor sequences. The proposed model is based on three main points. The first is that the processing of action-related sentences causes the resonance of motor and mirror neurons encoding the corresponding actions.The second is that there exists a varying degree of crosstalk between neuronal populations depending on whether they encode the same motor act, the same effector or the same action-goal. The third is the fact that neuronal populations' internal dynamics, which results from the combination of multiple processes taking place at different time scales, can facilitate or interfere with successive activations of the same or of partially overlapping pools.},

  Abstract                 = {{The most recent conceptualization of generative grammar is summarized, reviewing the work in the area over the last 40 years. A review of the goals \& necessary elements for a generative grammar are presented. Grammar is concerned with the internal language (I-language) of the speaker, which generates an infinite set of structural descriptions. The specific features of an account of I-language are outlined by drawing on previous analyses \& selecting \& refining elements; some basic features include the use of multiple layers of structure, empty categories, \& modular grouping of theories of structure. Features determining argument structure in the lexicon is described; it is argued these include semantic \& (residual) purely syntactic features. The principles of the computational system, \& general properties of dominance, command, government, empty categories, \& movement are defined, \& D-structure is discussed, addressing the notions specifier, C, I, \& D categories, \& whether VP \& AP have projections with functional heads. The derivation of S-structure with D-structure by Affect-(alpha) is described with respect to issues of quantification, covert/overt movement, expletives, crossover, \& parasitic gaps. Government is defined, along with the related notions of barriers \& intervention, which block government. Intervention is refined by introduction of a minimal chain condition. Binding theory covers constraints on bound anaphors in reference to problems of reflexives, disjoint reference, \& reciprocals. The concept "freedom" is refined \& the nature of PRO explored. The role of the case filter, insertions to provide case assigners, case \& theta-marking, \& the derivational level of the case filter application are discussed. A final section notes some outstanding areas not discussed, in particular, elliptical structures. 191 References. J. Fife}},

Situated learning is the study of how human knowledge develops in the course of activity, and especially how people create and interpret descriptions (representations) of what they are doing. This introduction provides a historical perspective of situated learning, including the work of Dewey, Bartlett, Vygotsky, and Ryle.

We think it is a challenge that can be met and that (importantly) can be met by arguing from within a general framework that accepts many of the basic premises of the work (in new robotics and in dynamical systems theory) that motivates such scepticism in the first place. Our strategy will be as follows. We begin (Section 1) by offering an account (an example and something close to a definition) of what we shall term Minimal Robust Representationalism (MRR). Sections 2 & 3 address some likely worries and questions about this notion. We end (Section 4) by making explicit the conditions under which, on our account, a science (e.g., robotics) may claim to be addressing cognitive phenomena.},

In conversation, speakers and addressees work together in the making of a definite reference. In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.},

  Abstract                 = {Spoken language is a result of the human capacity to assemble simple vocal units into more complex utterances, the basic carriers of semantic information. Not much is known about the evolutionary origins of this behaviour. The vocal abilities of non-human primates are relatively unimpressive in comparison, with gibbon songs being a rare exception. These apes assemble a repertoire of call notes into elaborate songs, which function to repel conspecific intruders, advertise pair bonds, and attract mates. We conducted a series of field experiments with white-handed gibbons at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, which showed that this ape species uses songs also to protect themselves against predation. We compared the acoustic structure of predatory-induced songs with regular songs that were given as part of their daily routine. Predator-induced songs were identical to normal songs in the call note repertoire, but we found consistent differences in how the notes were assembled into songs. The responses of out-of-sight receivers demonstrated that these syntactic differences were meaningful to conspecifics. Our study provides the first evidence of referential signalling in a free-ranging ape species, based on a communication system that utilises combinatorial rules.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we claim that meaningful representations can be learned by programs, although today they are almost al- ways designed by skilled engineers. We discuss several kinds of meaning that representations might have, and focus on a functional notion of meaning as appropriate for programs to learn. Specifically, a representation is meaningful if it incorporates an indicator of external conditions and if the indicator relation informs action. We survey methods for inducing kinds of representations we call structural abstractions. Prototypes of sensory time series are one kind of structural abstraction, and though they are not denoting or compositional, they do support planning. Deictic representations of objects and prototype representations of words enable a program to learn the denotational meanings of words. Finally, we discuss two algorithms designed to find the macroscopic structure of episodes in a domain-independent way.},

Spatial relations, we propose, are defined by correlations across different perceptual modalities. The nature of the correlations that define a relation determines how hard learning a word for that relation will be. We present a connectionist model that learns about relations in two phases, a pre-linguistic phase in which concepts are organized according to the perceptual input, and a linguistic phase, in which pre- existing concepts are re-organized under the influence of words. This model accounts for the order in which spatial relation terms are learned by children.},

Children correctly judged that a set labeled eight retains this label if it is unchanged, that it is not also four, and that eight is more than two. In contrast, children failed to judge that a set of 8 objects is better labeled by eight than by four, that eight is more than four, that eight continues to apply to a set whose members are rearranged, or that eight ceases to apply if the set is increased by 1, doubled, or halved. The latter errors contrast with children's correct application of words for the smallest numbers. These findings suggest that children interpret number words by relating them to 2 distinct preverbal systems that capture only limited numerical information. Children construct the system of abstract, natural number concepts from these foundations.},

Recent experiments have shown that iterated learning by human participants in the laboratory transforms an initially unstructured artificial language into one containing regularities that make the system more learnable and stable over time. Here, we explore the process of iterated learning in more detail by demonstrating exactly how one type of structure---compositionality---emerges over the course of these experiments. We introduce a method to precisely quantify the increasing ability of a language to systematically encode associations between individual components of meanings and signals over time and we examine how the system as a whole evolves to avoid ambiguity in these associations and generate adaptive structure.},

The results showed an interaction between the relative positions of objects and the linguistic roles that those objects play in the locative expression: proximity was a decreasing function of the distance between the head object in the expression and the prepositional clause object, and an increasing function the distance between the head and the third, distractor object.

In the context of work to specify general factors of a functional geometry mediating the use of spatial prepositions (Garrod & Sanford 1989; Coventry 1992, 1993), object-specific effects were investigated. Subjects described video scenes of various objects and their responses of in, on, over, and beside were monitored. The independent variables involved the manipulation of functionality specific to various types of objects. It was concluded that knowledge about how particular objects interact with each other contributes to the representation of functional relations which determine preposition usage. Therefore a specification of functional geometries cannot proceed without a prior formulation of our knowledge about the physical and social worlds.
Additionally two different experimental measures of prepositional covariance with the scenes were used: Lickert-scale judgements and sentence completions. Responses from two separate groups were compared. The findings indicated some agreement between the two measures, but also some differences in patterns of response. It is suggested that the measures are tapping different processes, and that a variety of methods need to be used to abstract to lexical representation.},

  Abstract                 = {Three experiments are reported which examined the role of geometry and functional relations in the comprehension of the spatial prepositions over, under, above, and below. The tasks used consisted of rating how appropriate sentences (containing one of these prepositions) were to describe a series of pictures. For example, the pictures comprised a person holding an object with the function of protection from falling objects (e.g., an umbrella). Each picture was depicted with the object shown as fulfilling its function or not at different geometric positions. The results of Experiment 1 show a significant effect of functional relations on the ratings given. However, while over/under were very sensitive to functional relations, above/below were more influenced by geometric relations. The second experiment replicates these effects with objects depicting noncanonical functions (e.g., a suitcase sheltering someone from rain). Experiment 3 manipulated frame of reference and found evidence for conflict of frames of reference effects on the rating of above/below, but not in the same way for over/under. Conversely the ratings of over/under were found to be affected by functionality while those for above/below were not. These results indicate for the first time that spatial prepositions are differentially influenced by geometric and functional relations. },

(1999). ``Near'' and ``far'' in language and perception. Cognition 73, 35--63], and has been hitherto under investigated. Two experiments examined the influence of object distance from speaker, tool use (participants pointed at objects with their finger/arm or with a stick), and interaction with objects (whether or not participants placed objects themselves) on spatial demonstrative use (e.g. this/that red triangle) in English (this/that) and Spanish (este/ese/aquel). The results show that the use of demonstratives across two languages is affected by distance from speaker and by both tool use and interaction with objects. These results support the view that spatial demonstrative use corresponds with a basic distinction between near and far perceptual space.},

We show that the number of other objects in a scene impacts upon quantifiers judgements even when those objects are in a different category to the focus objects.

  Abstract                 = {In Explaining Language Change (2000), I develop an evolutionary model of language change. This model is based on the philosopher of science David Hull's generalized analysis of selection, which is abstracted from biological specifics. In this model, I identify the replicators - the central units that evolve - as linguistic structures in utterances; they are replicated every time we open our mouths to speak. The interactors - whose behavior causes replicators to be replicated differentially - as the speakers who choose alternative forms to express meanings in particular social contexts. Variation is generated by phonetic factors in replication (for sound change) and functional factors (for grammatical change). Selection, that is, differential replication, is driven by social factors. In this paper, this model is outlined and updated, and used to address a number of outstanding issues in historical linguistics, including the role of children in language change, the invisible hand, the use of phylogeny reconstruction algorithms in genetic historical linguistics, the significance of convention and intentional behavior in language change, types of grammatical change, the integration of internal and external factors, the integration of sociohistorical linguistics and 'traditional' historical linguistics, and finally the integration of synchronic and diachronic linguistics.

In the latter case, however, the employment of evolutionary models is handicapped by the absence of data regarding the transition from our primate ancestors to the emergence of modern human language, which is found in all societies. All that we can go by is the archaeological record and the comparison of the social-cognitive abilities and communication systems of humans and other animals, particularly nonhuman primates. Because the study of the origin of human language does not depend on linguistic data, it is not discussed in this article. Even so, the area under review is vast and growing, and therefore this review is restricted to research in which qualitative concepts and quantitative methods from evolutionary biology have been applied to the analysis of language, in particular language change and language phylogeny.},

  Abstract                 = {[review 1]
Language, Mind and Brain is a delightfully readable, yet erudite exploration of how the human mind processes and orders sounds and words into meaning. It explores how properties of the human mind/brain constrain linguistic structure and how linguistics can benefit by combining traditional linguistic methodologies with insights from research on language acquisition, processing, and impairment. The first part of the book offers a useful introduction to the relevant issues for readers with little prior knowledge of these disciplines; part two addresses such key issues as the status of rules, the relationship between grammar and the lexicon, and the relationship between innate structure and acquired knowledge. Fascinating for anyone interested in the intricacies of how language is acquired and how the brain sorts sounds into communication.

[review 2]
In their day-to-day practice, few linguists have got a chance to break away from their favored way of doing linguistic analysis and question the deep foundational assumptions in their theoretical background. Such effort would take not only courage, but a lot of acuity and a broad range of knowledge. Such qualities are what I have seen in Ewa Dabrowska's new book Language, Mind and Brain. Dabrowska integrates an amazing range of recent findings from language processing, acquisition, impairment, comparative psychology and genetics that, taken together, provide rather straightforward and substantial support to the cognitive-constructional approaches to grammar.

In addition to a brief introduction, the book comprises two parts, titled "The Basic Specifications" and "The Building Blocks of Language", respectively. Part 1 is composed of five chapters, which develop a set of "design specifications" for a psychologically realistic linguistic theory. This section starts with the apparently paradoxical properties of language processing, namely, incredible speed and flexibility in tackling enormously complex puzzles in speech production and understanding. And all this can be accomplished in the human brain, which is a fairly slow processor compared with most modern computers. Such facts can only be understood, according to the author, by referring to the brain's capacity for parallel computation and using processing shortcuts, including storage of prefabricated units, shallow processing and sensitivity to frequency at all levels of linguistic organization. Thus instead of being economical, linguistic knowledge must be highly redundantly represented in the mind.

The next chapter tears down arguments for innate UG based on the apparent universal and uniform stages of language acquisition by stressing huge individual differences and the role of input in language development, even in cases of inauspicious circumstances such as those of blind children. Empirical facts therefore suggest that languages are learned, not acquired. In Chapter 4, the author brings in evidence from impairment studies showing that the classical strict localization view widely accepted in neurolinguistics cannot be maintained. Lexical and grammatical knowledge are rather closely intertwined and redundantly represented in a flexible architecture. The issue of impairment is further pursued in the next chapter, as it has too often been cited in the form of a double dissociation argument for the modularity hypothesis, namely, the impairment of language and general cognitive processes may happen independently of one another. The author carefully reexamines the classical cases that support the dissociation argument and points out the partialness in dissociation. It is suggested that different cognitive skills and abilities are implicated in language processing and acquisition to varying extent. The last chapter in this part examines neuroanatomical evidence for the so-called "language organ" and the status of Universal Grammar. The author concurs with the recent consensus that the human adaptations to language involve abilities evolved for other purposes.

Part 2 develops the basic specifications in more concrete detail in relation to specific aspects of linguistic organization. In Chapter 7, the author reexamines the arguments for an innate syntax module by looking at lexical acquisition of spatial terms. She highlights the rather sophisticated nature of lexical learning, which, however, is accomplished in a quick and spontaneous fashion without relying on innate lexical knowledge. By analogy, the author argues, syntax as well might be learnable without being innate. The nature of regular and irregular morphology is the concern of the next chapter, which is an issue that splits the connectionist and the dual-mechanism approaches. The author discusses evidence for the dual-mechanism model and pinpoints various problems in its argumentation. It is suggested that the same mechanism could in principle account for speakers' ability to supply regular and irregular inflections. Chapter 9 brings developmental data to bear on the notion of the lexicon-grammar continuum and presents rich evidence for a developmental course that starts with rote-learned formulas on the basis of which increasingly general formulaic frames and abstract templates are extracted. A detailed demonstration of this view is offered on the acquisition of English interrogative constructions, showing that lexically specific templates play an important role in both simple and long-distance dependency questions. The final chapter in this section introduces the basic principles of Cognitive Grammar as a psychologically realistic framework that meets the specifications discussed earlier.

The basic arguments and ideas in the book are organized in a way that underscores major differences with the mainstream generative positions. This way of presentation is of course quite familiar from the literature of cognitive linguistics. However, the strength of this work lies in its comprehensiveness and currentness, as shown in many of its fairly recent references. From the book, one could come away with a clear picture of the central issues under debate in language and cognition at this time in the 21st century, as well as the author's well-argued interpretation of the major findings on those issues. In addition, Dabrowska shows careful balance in her discussion of various positions. Much interesting evidence is provided that often helps the reader to rethink some of the commonly held assumptions in linguistics.

The only quibble I might have regards the weight the author assigns to the discussion of specific linguistic issues, which probably is a direct reflection of the author's rich experience in language acquisition research. The stated goal of the work, as reflected in its subtitle, is to discuss psychological and neurological constraints on theories of grammar. But theoretical matters in grammatical theories per se appear to have been given short shrift. Apart from a quick introduction to the basics of Cognitive Grammar, there is no substantial discussion of alternative theoretical approaches to specific issues in grammatical representation, though I do find points of delight in the author's discussion of long-distance dependency constructions from the perspectives of acquisition and production. As a practicing linguist, I would have been happier if I were more enlightened on how specific linguistic phenomena might be better approached under the assumption of the cognitive constraints discussed in the book. Nonetheless, with its overall clarity in the presentation of many cutting-edge research findings, the book will serve as a very good introduction to the empirical and cognitive foundations of construction grammars that will surely benefit beginning students in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguists at large.},

This contrasts with non- human communication systems, which for the most part are holistic - encoding a whole message through a single, gestalt form. Why does every human language adopt a compositional strategy? In this paper, we show that compositional language can arise automatically through grounded communication among populations of communicators. The proposed mechanism is the following: if a holistic and a compositional approach are in competition and if both structured (compositional) and atomic meanings need to be communicated, the holistic strategy becomes less successful as it does not recruit already acquired bits of language. We demonstrate the viability of this explanation through computer simulations in which populations of artificial agents perform a communicative task - describing scenes that they have observed. Successful language strategies (that is, those yielding successful transmission of information about a scene) are reinforced while unsuccessful ones are demoted. The simulations show that this reinforcement on the basis of communicative success indeed leads to the dominance of compositional language as long as the fraction of unstructured meaning to be communicated is sufficiently high. Moreover, following Elman (1993), we then show that the same effect can be achieved by, instead of manipulating the world (the fraction of unstructured meaning presented to the agents), letting the agents themselves go through developmental stages. These simulations confirm that simple reinforcement mechanisms applied during communicative interactions can account for the emergence of linguistic compositionality.},

  Abstract                 = {A computational language game model is presented that shows how a population of language users can evolve from a brightness-based to a brightness+hue-based color term system. The shift is triggered by a change in the communication challenges posed by the environment, com- parable to what happened in English during the Middle English period in response to the rise of dyeing and textile manufacturing c. 1150--1500. In a previous model that is able to explain such a shift, these two color categorization strategies were explicitly represented. This is not needed in our model. Instead, whether a population evolves a brightness- or a hue-based system is an emergent phenomenon that depends only on environmental factors. In this way, the model provides an explanation of how such a shift may come about without introducing additional mechanisms that would require further explanation.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing body of research on multi-agent systems bootstrapping a communication system. Most studies are based on simulation, but recently there has been an increased interest in the properties and formal analysis of these systems. Although very interesting and promising results have been obtained in these studies, they always rely on major simplifications. For example, although much larger populations are considered than was the case in most earlier work, previous work assumes the possibility of meaning transfer. With meaning transfer, two agents always exactly know what they are talking about. This is hardly ever the case in actual communication systems, as noise corrupts the agents' perception and transfer of meaning. In this paper we first consider what happens when relaxing the meaning-transfer assumption, and propose a cross-situational learning scheme that allows a population of agents to still bootstrap a common lexicon under this condition. We empirically show the validity of the scheme and thereby improve on the results reported in (Smith, 2003) and (Vogt and Coumans, 2003) in which no satisfactory solution was found. It is not our aim to reduce the importance of previous work, instead we are excited by recent results and hope to stimulate further research by pointing towards some new challenges.},

Despite the many interesting empirical results these studies have produced, most of this research lacks a formal elucidating theory. In this paper we show how a population of agents can reach linguistic consensus, i.e. learn to use one common language to communicate with one another. Our approach differs from existing formal work in two important ways: One, we relax the too strong assumption that an agent samples infinitely often during each time interval. This assumption is usually made to guarantee convergence of an empirical learning process to a deterministic dynamical system. Two, we provide a proof that under these new realistic conditions, our model converges to a common language for the entire population of agents. Finally the model is experimentally validated.},

The resulting neuro-computational framework is demonstrated to account for observed sequence learning behavior. More interestingly, this framework naturally extends to grammatical constructions as form-to-meaning mappings. Predictions from the neuro-computational model concerning parallels in language and cognitive sequence processing are tested against behavioral and neurophysiological observations in humans, resulting in a refinement of the allocation of model functions to subdivisions of Broca's area. From a functional perspective this analysis will provide insight into the relation between the coding structure in human languages, and constraints derived from the underlying neurophysiological computational mechanisms.},

While this demonstrated potential promise, it fell short in several aspects of providing a useful human-robot interaction system. The current research addresses three of these shortcomings, demonstrating the natural extensibility of the platform architecture. First, the system must be able not only to understand what it hears, but also to describe what it sees and to interact with the human user. This is a natural extension of the knowledge of sentence-to-meaning mappings that is now applied in the inverse scene-to-sentence sense. Secondly, we extend the system's ontology from physical events to include spatial relations. We will show that spatial relations are naturally accommodated in the predicate argument representations for events. Finally, because the robot community is international the robot should be able to speak multiple languages, and we thus demonstrate that the language model extends naturally to include both English and Japanese. Concrete results from a working interactive system are presented and future directions for adaptive human-robot interaction systems are outlined.},

The acquired grammatical construction knowledge generalizes, allowing the system to correctly understand new sentences not used in training. In the context of discourse, the grammatical constructions are used in the inverse sense to generate sentences from meanings, allowing the system to describe visual scenes that it perceives.

This has probably been inevitable given the limitied information available, but it is ultimately necessary that such question should be asked. Failure to do so is the equivalent of describing in minute detail the mechanical structures of motorcar, but refusing to ask either how cars came to be there or what they are used for. IF we do not undertand why we possess atrait (particularly one that appears to be all but unique to our species), we will never fully understand either its properties or its failures in individual cases.
Biologists have long been used to distinguishing four different kinds of questions that are now widley identified as Tinbergens' Four Whys' (Tinbergen 1963). These refer to questions about function (purporse), mechanism (the machinery), ontogeny (development) and phylogeny (evolutionary history). These four kinds of questions are logically independent of each other, but all need ultimately to be addressed if we are to claim that we have understood a phenomenon properly. Functional questionas are particularly important in this repsect, because they lead us to an understanding of just why traits exist. Hoever, functional questions are probably among the most difficult to deal with. Indeed function is particularly difficult to identify when only a single species possesses the trait, as is the case with language. Nonetheless, conderable in-roads can be made into these kinds of questions without having to resort to 'just-so-stroy-telling'.
In this chapter, I shall try to adres some of these issues. One crucial concern will be to identift the functional origins of language in humans. Another will be the relationshop between language and the phenomenon now known as 'theory of mind' (one of many elements in the mechanisms category). A third will be the evolutionary history of langauge: when did language first appear in the hominid lineage? My intention is not to give a full account in each case (these can be found elsewhere: for overviews, see Dunbar 1996), but rather to draw attention to the kinds of questions that we need to ask and to the kinds of answers that these questions require.},

  Abstract                 = {Languages vary widely but not without limit. The central goal of linguistics is to describe the diversity of human languages and explain the constraints on that diversity. Generative linguists following Chomsky have claimed that linguistic diversity must be constrained by innate parameters that are set as a child learns a language1,2. In contrast, other linguists following Greenberg have claimed that there are statistical tendencies for co-occurrence of traits reflecting universal systems biases3--5, rather than absolute constraints or parametric variation. Here we use computational phylogenetic methods to address the nature of constraints on linguistic diversity in an evolutionary framework6. First, contrary to the generative account of parameter setting, we show that the evolution of only a few word-order features of languages are strongly correlated. Second, contrary to the Greenbergian generalizations, we show that most observed functional dependencies between traits are lineage-specific rather than universal tendencies. These findings support the view that---at least with respect to word order---cultural evolution is the primary factor that determines linguistic structure, with the current state of a linguistic system shaping and constraining future states.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolution is one of the major omnipresent powers in the universe that has been studied for about two centuries. Recent scientific and technical developments make it possible to make the transition from passively understanding to actively using evolutionary processes. Today this is possible in Evolutionary Computing, where human experimenters can design and manipulate all components of evolutionary processes in digital spaces. We argue that in the near future it will be possible to implement artificial evolutionary processes outside such imaginary spaces and make them physically embodied. In other words, we envision the ``Evolution of Things'', rather than just the evolution of digital objects, leading to a new field of Embodied Artificial Evolution (EAE). The main objective of this paper is to present a unifying vision in order to aid the development of this high potential research area. To this end, we introduce the notion of EAE, discuss a few examples and applications, and elaborate on the expected benefits as well as the grand challenges this developing field will have to address.},

  Abstract                 = {Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been a prerequisite for the development of human culture. The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth1, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino- acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term ``generative'' is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both ``inductive'' and ``deductive'' science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling provides a powerful way to address certain enduring---and especially interdisciplinary---questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories---such as neoclassical microeconomics---to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise---or ``map up''---to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (``bottom up'') models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theoretical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent-based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science---some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since ``emergence'' figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible.},

  Abstract                 = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition.Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels.

INTRODUCTION Cognitive Linguistics is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of language, mind and socio-cultural experience that first emerged in the 1970s. Cognitive Linguistics is characterised by a commitment to the inseparability of meaning and form in the study of language. It also takes the view that language reflects general aspects of cognition, rather than adopting a modular view of mind. A further feature of the approach is the view that language is best studied in the context of, and indeed emerges from, use. Cognitive linguists have predominantly focused on two general areas of enquiry: the study of language organisation (cognitive approaches to grammar), and language as a means of studying aspects of conceptual structure (cognitive semantics). Cognitive Linguistics is an increasingly influential approach in cognitive science, social science and applied linguistics.
FOUNDATIONAL WORKS Cognitive Linguistics emerged from research conducted by prominent scholars working on the West Coast of the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. Most notable among these are Langacker (Langacker 1987; Langacker 1991), who developed the theory of *Cognitive Grammar*, Lakoff (Lakoff 1987), who applied work on categorisation to metaphor, lexical semantics and grammar, and Talmy (Talmy 2000), who studied the conceptual basis of grammar. These three researchers are widely considered to be the founding fathers of the enterprise. Also foundational was Lakoff and Johnson 1980, which developed *Conceptual Metaphor Theory*, as well as Johnson's 1987 development of the theory of Images Schemas (*Image Schema Theory*), which grew out of the work on conceptual metaphors. Other important work that has proved to be foundational was developed by Fillmore (Fillmore 1982), on *Frame Semantics*, and Fillmore et al. 1988, which provided the basis for the theory of *Construction Grammar*. Finally Fauconnier 1985 developed the theory of Mental Spaces (*Mental Spaces Theory*), which later gave rise to *Conceptual Integration Theory*.
Fauconnier, G. 1994. Mental spaces. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press. This work developed a cognitive linguistic approach to meaning construction and discourse semantics. This perspective was foundational for the later development of *Conceptual Integration Theory*. Originally published by MIT Press in 1985.

COGNITIVE GRAMMAR Cognitive Grammar is an approach to grammatical structure developed by Ronald Langacker. Langacker 2008, is the most recent and most authoritative overview of the theory. Cognitive Grammar has been applied, in particular, to locative expressions, as exemplified by Lindner 1981, the relation between nominal and clausal structures to the speech event, referred to as grounding in Cognitive Grammar. An exemplar is Brisard 2002. Much work has also been conducted on possessive constructions, for instance Taylor 2001. There has been a considerable amount of work conducted on clause structure, for example Tuggy 1988, including transitivity, Rice 1987, voice, Maldonado 1992, and case markers, Janda 1993. Van Hoek 1997 is an important treatment of anaphora within Cognitive Grammar.

However, since Fillmore's seminal work, a number of distinct constructional theories have emerged. These include Cognitive Construction Grammar, as exemplified in Lakoff 1987, and Goldberg 1995, Goldberg 2006, Radical Construction Grammar, Croft 2001, Embodied Construction Grammar, Bergen and Chang 2005, and most recently Sign-based Construction Grammar, Sag 2010.

CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION THEORY Conceptual integration, or ``blending'', is an account of dynamic meaning construction. The standard reference work is provided by the theory's two architects, Fauconnier and Turner 2002. The role of frame structure in giving rise to blends is best exemplified by Coulson 2000. There is now also good ERP evidence for the role of conceptual integration in meaning construction, Coulson and Van Petten 2002. The framework has been applied to literary texts and the staging of such texts, Cook 2010, to rhetoric, Oakley 1998, grammar, Mandelblit 1997, and sign language, Liddell 2000. The framework has also been applied to the
9
development of material anchors that ground blends, for instance in time-telling, Williams 2005. And finally, the relationship between conceptual integration and figurative language, especially metaphor, has also been explored, Grady, Oakley and Coulson 1999.

CONCEPTUAL METAPHOR THEORY Conceptual Metaphor Theory was developed by Lakoff and Johnson. The definitive treatment is Lakoff and Johnson 1999. An Important theoretical advance concerns the theory of primary metaphors, Grady 1997, as well as the extension to work on conceptual metonymy, K{\"o}vecses and Radden 1998. It has been applied to an extremely wide range of areas including the study of poetics, Lakoff and Turner 1989, language change, Sweetser 1990, political science, Lakoff 2003, discourse, Musolff and Zinken 2009, and gestural studies, Cienki and M{\"u}ller 2008. An influential study examining the empirical foundation for the theory is Gibbs 1994.

FRAME SEMANTICS Frame Semantics evolved from Fillmore's original work on Case Theory, Fillmore 1968. While Fillmore worked on the theory of Frame Semantics in the 1970s, the two best- developed accounts appeared in the 1980s: Fillmore 1982, and Fillmore 1985. Since then the details of Frame Semantics have been worked out in a number of contexts, including from the perspective of lexicography, Fillmore and Atkins 1992, and more recently, in terms of computational implementation under the guise of the **FrameNet** project. The architecture for FrameNet is presented in Boas 2005, its tagset is discussed by Johnson and Fillmore 2000, and the structure of its database is discussed in Baker et al. 2003.

IMAGE SCHEMA THEORY The theoretical construct of the image schema was developed by Johnson 1987. The most detailed treatment of a single image schema is Cienki 1998, and there is empirical evidence for the existence of image schemas found in Gibbs and Colston 1995. It has been claimed that image schemas form the basis for conceptual metaphors (Lakoff 1993), and that they underpin lexical categories (Lakoff 1987). Moreover, it is argued that they are foundational for conceptual development more generally (Mandler 2004). Clausner and Croft 1999 examine image schemas in relation to conceptual domains, while Palmer 1996 applies image schemas to cultural analysis. Finally, an extremely useful collection, which surveys perspectives on image schemas, is Hampe 2005.

LCCM THEORY [The Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models]
114
The basis for LCCM Theory lies in the methodological approach to lexical representation pioneered in spatial semantics by Tyler and Evans 2003, and in the domain of time by Evans 2004. The theoretical architecture of LCCM Theory is developed in Evans 2009, and its application to figurative language and abstract thought is worked out in Evans 2010.

MENTAL SPACES THEORY The definitive statement on Mental Spaces Theory is Fauconnier 1994. Dinsmore 1987 argues for the role of mental spaces in reasoning. Cutrer 1994 applies Mental Spaces Theory to tense and aspect, while Dancygier and Sweetser 2005 apply it to conditionals. Fauconnier 1997 develops Mental Spaces Theory in anticipation of the development of Conceptual Integration Theory. Mok et al. 2004 is a computerised implementation of Mental Spaces Theory. Oakley and Hougaard 2008 provides a collection of important papers relating to Mental Spaces Theory by leading proponents.

PROTOTYPE THEORY Prototype Theory arose during the 1970s from experimental findings associated with Rosch 1978. It was famously developed and applied to language science by Lakoff 1987. Geeraerts 1997 applies Prototype Theory to lexicography, while Tyler and Evans 2001 is a detailed application to lexical semantics. Lakoff and K{\"o}vecses 1987 apply the notion of prototypes to metaphor, while Peirsman and Geeraerts 2006 apply it to metonymy. Wierzbicka 1990 provides a critique of the way in which prototypes are made use of in language studies.

USAGE-BASED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE LEARNING Usage-based approaches to language learning have focused on the way mental grammar comes to be organised and structured (Langacker 2000), and the way language is acquired (Tomasello 2003). In terms of the former, Bybee 2006 provides evidence for the role of frequency, while Bybee and Hopper 2001 is an important collection of papers in this regard. Bybee 2010 presents a synthesis of the state of the art. Barlow and Kemmer 2000 is an

influential collection relating to more general issues concerning mental grammar and usage. In terms of language acquisition, Langacker 2009 provides a recent theoretical treatment, while Lieven et al. 2003 provides a classic case study in favour of a usage-based approach to first language acquisition.

  Abstract                 = {Conceptual Integration -- "blending" -- is a general cognitive operation on a par with analogy, recursion, mental modeling, conceptual categorization, and framing. It serves a variety of cognitive purposes. It is dynamic, supple, and active in the moment of thinking. It yields proucts that frequently become entrenched in conceptual structure and grammar, and it oftern performs new work on its previously entrenched products as inputs. Blending is easy to detect in spectacular cases but it is for most part a routine, workaday process that escapes detection except on technical analyiss. It is not reserved for special purposes, and is not costly.
In blending, structure from input mental spaces is projected to a separate, "blended" metnal space. The projection is selective. Through completion and elaboration, the blend develops structure not provided by the inputs. Inferences, rguments, and ideas developed in the blend can have effect in cognition, leading us to modify the initial inputs and to change our view of the corresponding situations.
Blending operates according to a set of uniform structural and dynamic principles. It additionally observers a set of optimality principles.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper began with the question 'What is the correct logic of vagueness?' This led to the further question 'What are the correct truth-conditions for a vague language', which led, in its turn, to a more general consideration of meaning and existence. The first half of the paper con- tains the basic material. Section 1 expounds and criticizes one approach to the problem of truth-conditions. It is based upon an extension of the standard truth-tables and falls foul of something called penumbral con- nection. Section 2 introduces an alternative framework, within which penumbral connection can be accommodated. The key idea is to consider not only the truth-values that sentences actually receive but also the truth- values that they might receive under different ways of making them more precise. Section 3 describes and defends the favoured account within this framework. Very roughly, it says that a vague sentence is true if and only if it is true for all ways of making it completely precise. The second half of the paper deals with consequences, complications and comparisons. Sec- tion 4 considers the consequences that the rival approaches have for logic. The favoured account leads to a classical logic for vague sentences; and objections to this unpopular position are met. Section 5 studies the phe- nomenon of higher order vagueness: first, in its bearing upon the truth- conditions for a language that contains a definitely-operator or a hierar- chy of truth-predicates; and second, in its relation to some puzzles con- cerning priority and eliminability.},

Recent genomic investigations indicate that its downstream neural targets make broader impacts on common language impairments, bridging clinically distinct disorders. Moreover, the striking conservation of both FoxP2 sequence and neural expression in different vertebrates facilitates the use of animal models to study ancestral pathways that have been recruited towards human speech and language. Intriguingly, reduced FoxP2 dosage yields abnormal synaptic plasticity and impaired motor-skill learning in mice, and disrupts vocal learning in songbirds. Converging data indicate that Foxp2 is important for modulating the plasticity of relevant neural circuits. This body of research represents the first functional genetic forays into neural mechanisms contributing to human spoken language.},

  Abstract                 = {Binocular distance perception is not veridical. A constant binocular disparity corresponds neither to a constant perceived depth nor to a constant perceived distance ratio. Perceived relative distance depends on physical distance as well as disparity. This implies the existence of an egocentric distance signal. A model is proposed that attributes all of the error in binocular distance perception to a misperception of egocentric distance and a difference in the effective magnificationsin the two eyes. Perceived distance of near targets exceeds physical distance; perceived distance of far targets is less than physical distance. The model describes a large body of data in which subjects set distances to satisfy various relative perceived distance criteria. The misperception of egocentric distance is also manifested in a variety of experiments in which the subject directly indicates perceived egocentric distance. The egocentric distance signal appears to be of extraretinal origin and to be related to the vergence of the eyes.},

  Abstract                 = {The issue of how children learn the meaning of words is fundamental to developmental psychology. The recent attempts to develop or evolve efficient communication protocols among interacting robots or virtual agents have brought that issue to a central place in more applied research fields, such as computational linguistics and neural networks, as well. An attractive approach to learning an object--word mapping is the so-called cross-situational learning. This learning scenario is based on the intuitive notion that a learner can determine the meaning of a word by finding something in common across all observed uses of that word. Here we show how the deterministic Neural Modeling Fields (NMF) categorization mechanism can be used by the learner as an efficient algorithm to infer the correct object--word mapping. To achieve that we first reduce the original on-line learning problem to a batch learning problem where the inputs to the NMF mechanism are all possible object--word associations that could be inferred from the cross-situational learning scenario. Since many of those associations are incorrect, they are considered as clutter or noise and discarded automatically by a clutter detector model included in our NMF implementation. With these two key ingredients -- batch learning and clutter detection -- the NMF mechanism was capable to infer perfectly the correct object--word mapping.},

This paper explores some cognitive aspects of perception and knowledge representation and explains why spatial knowledge is of particular interest for cognitive science. It is suggested that `spatial inference engines' provide the basis for rather general cognitive capabilities inside and outside the spatial domain. The role of abstraction in spatial reasoning and the advantages of qualitative spatial knowledge over quantitative knowledge are discussed. The usefulness of spatial representations with a low degree of abstraction is shown. An example from vision (the aquarium domain) is used to illustrate in which ways knowledge about space may be uncertain or incomplete. Parallels are drawn between the spatial and the temporal domains. A concrete approach for the representation of qualitative spatial knowledge on the basis of `conceptual neighborhood' is suggested and some potential application areas are mentioned.},

For feasibility studies of Robot Entertainment, we have developed an autonomous quadruped robot, named MUTANT, as a pet-type robot. It has four legs, each of which has three degree-of-freedom, and a head which also has three degree-of-freedom. Micro camera, stereo microphone, touch sensors, and other sensor systems are coupled with newly developed behavior generation system, which has emotion module as its major components, and generates high complex and interactive behaviors. Agent architecture, real-world recognition technologies, software component technology, and some dedicated devices such as Micro Camera Unit, were developed and tested for this purpose. From the lessons learned from the development of MUTANT, we refined the design concept of MUTANT to derive requirements for a general architecture and a set of interfaces of robot systems for entertainment applications. Through these feasibility studies, we consider entertainment applications a significant target at this moment from both scientific and engineering points of view. 1},

  Abstract                 = {There has been a great deal of research on language, but usually it dissects an existing language and treats it as a static set of rules that is used more or less accurately and successfully to convey meaning. Here we are interested in the emergence of new communication systems and in their expansion and adaptation in usage. We seek a theory of the kind of cognitive mechanisms and interaction patterns necessary to bootstrap, maintain, and adapt a communication system that has similar properties as those found in human languages, such as those identified by Hockett (1960): discreteness, displacement, productivity, duality of patterning, etc.

The question of the emergence and continuous adaptation of communication systems is obviously relevant to the question of the origins of human languages, which has been lately at the center of increasing attention (e.g. Larson et al. 2007). In fact, we believe that these questions should receive attention from every student of language, for two reasons. The first one is that language, as any other complex social or biological phenomenon, cannot be thoroughly understood in the absence of a theory about its origins. The second reason is that research on language use (e.g. Clark 1996) has shown that even ``mature'' languages like English and the conceptual repertoires they employ undergo constant change. Language and conceptual systems are continuously adapting to cope with the problems of communicating novel meanings in novel settings, and these systems are coordinated between speakers and listeners via a multilevel process of alignment (Pickering and Garrod 2004). This dynamic nature of language suggests that linguistics (both descriptive and computational) should pay more attention to the processes that give rise to language and constantly reshape it, and that language should be viewed as a complex, adaptive system rather than as the static, formal calculus definable by generative grammars (Steels 2000; Tomasello 2005).

This paper focuses on models that attempt to capture this dynamic nature of language. In addition, it focuses on issues related to communication between embodied agents. },

In this article we provide a unifying neural hypothesis on how individuals understand the actions and emotions of others. Our main claim is that the fundamental mechanism at the basis of the experiential understanding of others' actions is the activation of the mirror neuron system. A similar mechanism, but involving the activation of viscero-motor centers, underlies the experiential understanding of the emotions of others.},

As such, they must somehow be the result of neural activity in the brain. The questions are: Where? and How? A common philosophical position is that all concepts---even concepts about action and perception---are symbolic and abstract, and therefore must be implemented outside the brain's sensory-motor system. We will argue against this position using (1) neuroscientific evidence; (2) results from neural computation; and (3) results about the nature of concepts from cognitive linguistics. We will propose that the sensory-motor system has the right kind of structure to characterise both sensory-motor and more abstract concepts. Central to this picture are the neural theory of language and the theory of cogs, according to which, brain structures in the sensory-motor regions are exploited to characterise the so-called ``abstract'' concepts that constitute the meanings of grammatical constructions and general inference patterns.},

It revolves around the analysis of the spatial descriptions which emerge during the course of 56 dialogues, elicited in the laboratory using a specially designed computer maze game. Two types of analysis are reported. The first is a semantic analysis of the various types of description, which indicates how pairs of speakers develop different language schemes associated with different mental models of the maze configuration. The second analysis concerns how the communicants coordinate in developing their description schemes. The results from this study would suggest that language processing in dialogue may be governed by local principles of interaction which have received little attention in the psychological and linguistic literature to date.},

Whereas the isolated pairs show higher degrees of inter-speaker convergence than the community pairs at the start of the experiment, the situation reverses by the time they have all played six or more games. The results are discussed at two levels: (1) in terms of Lewis's formal theory of conventions, and (2) in relation to a language processing model which abides by the ``output/input co-ordination'' principleproposed in Garrod and Anderson (1987).},

  Abstract                 = {Dialog is a joint action at different levels. At the highest level, the goal of interlocutors is to align their mental representations. This emerges from joint activity at lower levels, both concerned with linguistic decisions (e.g., choice of words) and nonlinguistic processes (e.g., alignment of posture or speech rate). Because of the high-level goal, the interlocutors are particularly concerned with close coupling at these lower levels. As we illustrate with examples, this means that imitation and entrainment are particularly pronounced during interactive communication. We then argue that the mechanisms underlying such processes involve covert imitation of interlocutors' communicative behavior, leading to emulation of their expected behavior. In other words, communication provides a very good example of predictive emulation, in a way that leads to successful joint activity.},

This is clearly not the case. We argue that conversation is easy because of an interactive processing mechanism that leads to the alignment of linguistic representations between partners. Interactive alignment occurs via automatic alignment channels that are functionally similar to the automatic links between perception and behaviour (the so-called perception -- behaviour expressway) proposed in recent accounts of social interaction. We conclude that humans are `designed' for dialogue rather than monologue.},

Using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, we annotated all the verbal targets associated with a set of frames which includes frames of spatial motion, manipulation, and health. One surprising finding was that over 90% of annotated targets from these frames are used metaphorically, underscoring the importance of processing figurative language. We then used this labeled data and each verbal target's PropBank annotation to train a maximum entropy classifier to make this literal vs. metaphoric distinction. Using the classifier, we reduce the final error in the test set by 5% over the verb-specific majority class baseline and 31% over the corpus-wide majority class baseline.},

Two mapping principles are decribed: (1) Relations between objects, rather than attributes of objects, are mapped from base to target, and (b) The particular relations mapped are determined by systmeaticity, as defined by the existence of higher-order relations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present LPG, a fast planner using local search for solving planning graphs. LPG can use various heuristics based on a parametrized objective function. These parameters weight different types of inconsistencies in the partial plan represented by the current search state, and are dynamically evaluated during search using Lagrange multipliers. LPG's basic heuristic was inspired by Walksat, which in Kautz and Selman's Blackbox can be used to solve the SAT-encoding of a planning graph. An advantage of LPG is that its heuristics exploit the structure of the planning graph, while Blackbox relies on general heuristics for SAT-problems, and requires the translation of the planning graph into propositional clauses. Another major difference is that LPG can handle action costs to produce good quality plans. This is achieved by an ``anytime'' process minimizing an objective function based on the number of inconsistencies in the partial plan and on its overall cost. The objective function can also take into account the number of parallel steps and the overall plan duration. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of our approach showing, in particular, that for a set of well-known benchmark domains LPG is significantly faster than existing Graphplan-style planners.},

We explore the possibility that the human motor system uses such a modular decomposition strategy to learn the visuomotor map, the relationship between visual inputs and motor outputs. Using a virtual reality system, subjects were exposed to opposite prism-like visuomotor remappings---discrepancies between actual and visually perceived hand locations---for movements starting from two distinct locations. Despite this conflicting pairing between visual and motor space, subjects learned the two starting-point-dependent visuomotor mappings and the generalization of this learning to intermediate starting locations demonstrated an interpolation of the two learned maps. This interpolation was a weighted average of the two learned visuomotor mappings, with the weighting sigmoidally dependent on starting location---a prediction made by a computational model of modular learning known as the ``mixture of experts''. These results provide evidence that the brain may employ a modular decomposition strategy during learning.},

Psychophysical results from two sensorimotor systems, subserving the integration and adaptation of visuo-auditory maps, and estimation of the state of the hand during arm movements, are presented and analyzed within this framework. These results suggest that: (1) Spatial information from visual and auditory systems is integrated so as to reduce the variance in localization. (2) The effects of a remapping in the relation between visual and auditory space can be predicted from a simple learning rule. (3) The temporal propagation of errors in estimating the hand's state is captured by a linear dynamic observer, providing evidence for the existence of an internal model which simulates the dynamic behavior of the arm.},

Most theories in cognitive science view meaning in terms of propositional structures that may be combined to form higher-order complexes in representing the meanings of conversations and texts. A newer approach seeks to capture meaning in terms of high-dimensional semantic space. Both views reflect the idea that meaning is best understood as abstract and disembodied symbols. My aim in this article is to make the case for an embodied view of linguistic meaning. This view provides a challenge to traditional approaches to linguistic meaning (although may not necessarily be entirely incompatible with them). I discuss several new lines of research from both linguistics and psychology that explore the importance of embodied perception and action in people's understanding of words, phrases, and texts. These data provide strong evidence in favor of the idea that significant aspects of thought and language arises from, and is grounded in, embodiment.},

Given an input sentence and a target word and frame, the system labels constituents with either abstract semantic roles, such as Agent or Patient, or more domain-specific semantic roles, such as Speaker, Message, and Topic.

The system is based on statistical classifiers trained on roughly 50,000 sentences that were hand-annotated with semantic roles by the FrameNet semantic labeling project. We then parsed each training sentence into a syntactic tree and extracted various lexical and syntactic features, including the phrase type of each constituent, its grammatical function, and its position in the sentence. These features were combined with knowledge of the predicate verb, noun, or adjective, as well as information such as the prior probabilities of various combinations of semantic roles. We used various lexical clustering algorithms to generalize across possible fillers of roles. Test sentences were parsed, were annotated with these features, and were then passed through the classifiers.

Our system achieves 82% accuracy in identifying the semantic role of presegmented con- stituents. At the more difficult task of simultaneously segmenting constituents and identifying their semantic role, the system achieved 65% precision and 61% recall.

Our study also allowed us to compare the usefulness of different features and feature combi- nation methods in the semantic role labeling task. We also explore the integration of role labeling with statistical syntactic parsing and attempt to generalize to predicates unseen in the training data.},

In contrast, participants in three experiments found it trivially easy to discriminate between descriptions of sensible novel situations (e.g., using a newspaper to protect one's face from the wind) and nonsense novel situations (e.g., using a matchbook to protect one's face from the wind). These results support the Indexical Hypothesis that the meaning of a sentence is constructed by (a) indexing words and phrases to real objects or perceptual, analog symbols; (b) deriving affordances from the objects and symbols; and (c) meshing the affordances under the guidance of syntax.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of action must come to terms with both the details of language use and the way in which the social, cultural, material and sequential structure of the environment where action occurs figure into its organization. In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry out courses of action in concert with each other through talk while attending to both the larger activities that their current actions are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action being invoked through talk would be impossible. In brief it will be argued that the construction of action through talk within situated interaction is accomplished through the temporally unfolding juxtaposition of quite different kinds of semiotic resources, and that moreover through this process the human body is made publicly visible as the site for a range of structurally different kinds of displays implicated in the constitution of the actions of the moment.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a computational theory of situated language understanding in which the meaning of words and utterances depends on the physical environment and the goals and plans of communication partners. According to the theory, concepts that ground linguistic meaning are neither internal nor external to language users, but instead span the objective-subjective boundary. To model the possible interactions between subject and object, the theory relies on the notion of perceived affordances: structured units of interaction that can be used for prediction at multiple levels of abstraction. Language understanding is treated as a process of filtering perceived affordances. The theory accounts for many aspects of the situated nature of human language use and provides a unified solution to a number of demands on any theory of language understanding including conceptual combination, prototypicality effects, and the generative nature of lexical items.
To support the theory, we describe an implemented system that understands verbal commands situated in a virtual gaming environment. The implementation uses probabilistic hierarchical plan recognition to generate perceived affordances. The system has been evaluated on its ability to correctly interpret free-form spontaneous verbal commands recorded from unrehearsed game play between human players. The system is able to ``step into the shoes'' of human players and correctly respond to a broad range of verbal commands in which linguistic meaning depends on social and physical context. We quantitatively compare the system's predictions in response to direct player commands with the actions taken by human players and show generalization to unseen data across a range of situations and verbal constructions.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a visually-grounded language understanding model based on a study of how people verbally describe objects in scenes. The emphasis of the model is on the combination of individual word meanings to produce meanings for complex referring expressions. The model has been implemented, and it is able to understand a broad range of spatial referring expressions. We describe our implementation of word level visually-grounded semantics and their embedding in a compositional parsing framework. The implemented system selects the correct referents in response to natural language expressions for a large percentage of test cases. In an analysis of the system's successes and failures we reveal how visual context influences the semantics of utterances and propose future extensions to the model that take such context into account.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary theory lacks a term for a crucial concept---a feature, now useful to an organism, that did not arise as an adaptation for its present role, but was subsequently coopted for its current function. I call such features ``exaptations'' and show that they are neither rare nor arcane, but dominant features of evolution---though previously unappreciated in the context of the overly adaptationist neo-Darwinian theory. This article argues that exaptation overcomes the fallacy of human sociobiology, helps us to understand the major patterns of flexibility and contingency in life's history, revises the roles of structure and function in evolutionary theory, serves as a centerpiece for grasping the origin and meaning of brain size in human evolution, and thereby cries out for recognition as a key to evolutionary psychology. Historical origin and current utility are distinct concepts and must never be conflated.},

  Abstract                 = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past forty years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary "traits" and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analyzed as integrated wholes, with Baupl{\"a}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development, and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of nonadaptive structures. We support darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptation has been defined and recognized by two different criteria: historical genesis (features built by natural selection for their present role) and current utility (features now enhancing fitness no matter how they arose). Biologists have often failed to recognize the potential confusion between these different definitions because we have tended to view natural slection as so dominant among evolutionary mechanisms that historical process and current product beceom one. Yet if many deatures of organisms are non-adapted, but available for useful cooptation in descendants, then an important concept has no name in our lexicon (and unnamed ideas generally remain unconsidered): featyres that now enhance fitness but were not built by natural selection for their current role. We propose that such features be called exaptations and that adpataion be restricted, as Darin suggeste, to features built by selection for their current role. We present several examples of exaptation, indication where a failure to conceptualize such an idea limited he range of hypotheses previously available. We explore several consequences of expatation and propose a terminological solution to the problem of preadaptation.},

Miller and Johnson-Laird's Language and Perception (1976) can be considered a starting point of the psychological and linguistic investigation into deictic and intrinsic spatial reference, i.e. into the use and the comprehension of spatial prepositions and their corresponding spatial concepts. Important factors that affect the choice of either the deictic or the intrinsic frame of reference have been suggested to be the discourse context, the static vs. dynamic characteristics of the described situation, the individual cognitive style, and the intrinsic orientation of the reference object. However, the explanatory determination of people's actual use of spatial expressions is far from being satisfactory.
We conducted a series of experiments in German, Dutch, French, Italian and English in order to show that four factors systematically interact when people interpret spatial expressions: (1) the reference object being intrinsically oriented or not; (2) the preposition that is used; (3) the social characteristics of the discourse situation; (4) the prepositional inventory of the language at issue, as regards its spatial and temporal prepositions. Particularly, factors (3) and (4) allow for a more comprehensive explanation of the empirical results, compared to the hitherto proposed approaches. In all five languages, some communicative fuzziness, or ambiguity, remains; however, it occurs in different cases, depending on the prepositional inventories of the respective languages.},

This claim opposes the thesis that the common use is based upon an analogy between concrete space and other domains. The development of geometry from Euclid's Elements to more differentiated systems of diverse geometries and topologies can be perceived of as an example of the transfer from modeling concrete space towards describing abstract spatial structures.},

We also consider the way in which incremental interpretation can guide the syntactic processing, and pay particular attention to the use of referential information during parsing. We address these issues in terms of the computational models of Bobrow and Webber (1980a, b), Winograd (1972), Mellish (1985), and Haddock (1988). In each case, we ask two questions: First, to what extent does the program embody an incremental process of semantic interpretation? Secondly, how does this process help resolve syntactic ambiguities encountered by the parser? Here we will relate the behaviour of the models to the psychological theory of ambiguity resolution offered by Crain and Steedman (1985). In the context of this review, we identify some of the specific problems involved in incremental interpretation, and compare the computational techniques which have been applied to these problems.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the "symbol grounding problem": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) "iconic representations" , which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) "categorical representations" , which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations" , grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., "An X is a Y that is Z"). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic "module," however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically "dedicated" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

  Abstract                 = {This study explores the commonalities between linguistic and visual representations of space. In particular, because common types of spatial relations, specifically closed-class spatial forms in language and qualitative spatial relations in perception, have been proposed in both representational systems, we investigate whether they share underlying structural similarities. Moreover, while visual spatial relations are a basic element of several theories of object representation, they have been characterized mainly in terms of their linguistic counterparts and without direct evidence about their organization. In order to illuminate the nature of these structures, as well as demonstrate possible correspondences between the two systems, we compare how the spatial relationship between pairs of objects in a scene is encoded linguistically and visually. Spatial language was investigated by having subjects either generate (Experiment 1) or rate the applicability of (Experiment 2) spatial terms for describing the spatial relationship between object pairs. Both the frequency of use and the applicability of spatial terms were highest when the two objects were in vertical or in horizontal alignment. Spatial representation was investigated by paradigms in which subjects either recalled the position of one object relative to the other (Experiment 3) or judged whether one object presented sequentially was in the same or a different position relative to the other (Experiment 4). The accuracy of position estimates and the sensitivity to shifts in position were both highest when the rated object was in a spatial location where spatial terms had been judged to have high applicability in Experiments 1 and 2. These results indicate that the structure of space as encoded by language may be determined by the structure of spatial relations in visual representation.},

  Abstract                 = {The Hidden Vector State (HVS) model is an extension of the basic discrete Markov model in which context is encoded as a stack-oriented state vector. State transitions are factored into a stack shift operation similar to those of a push-down automaton followed by the push of a new preterminal category label. When used as a semantic parser, the model can capture hierarchical structure without the use of treebank data for training and it can be trained automatically using Expectation-Maximization (EM) from only-lightly annotated training data. When deployed in a system, the model can be continually refined as more data becomes available.
In this paper, the practical application of the model in a spoken language understanding system (SLU) is described. Through a sequence of experiments, the issues of robustness to noise and portability to similar and extended domains are investigated. The end-to-end performance obtained from experiments in the ATIS domain show that the system is comparable to existing SLU systems which rely on either hand-crafted semantic grammar rules or statistical models trained on fully- annotated training corpora. Experiments using data which has been artificially corrupted with varying levels of additive noise show that the HVS-based parser is relatively robust, and experiments using data sets from other domains indicate that the overall framework allows adaptation to related domains, and scaling to cover enlarged domains.
In summary, it is argued that constrained statistical parsers such as the HVS model allow robust spoken dialogue systems to be built at relatively low cost, and which can be automatically adapted as new data is acquired both to improve performance and extend coverage.},

[about]
Addresses key questions in the origins and evolution of language 
* Was there single ancestral language or several? 
* What was the structure of the earliest language? 
* How did the properties of modern languages arise?
* Presents the first reconstruction of all major grammatical categories

Written in a clear, jargon-free style
This book reconstructs what the earliest grammars might have been and shows how they could have led to the languages of modern humankind.

Like other biological phenomena, language cannot be fully understood without reference to its evolution, whether proven or hypothesized," wrote Talmy Giv{\'o}n in 2002. As the languages spoken 8,000 years ago were typologically much the same as they are today and as no direct evidence exists for languages before then, evolutionary linguists are at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts in biology. Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva seek to overcome this obstacle by combining grammaticalization theory, one of the main methods of historical linguistics, with work in animal communication and human evolution. The questions they address include: do the modern languages derive from one ancestral language or from more than one? What was the structure of language like when it first evolved? And how did the properties associated with modern human languages arise, in particular syntax and the recursive use of language structures? The authors proceed on the assumption that if language evolution is the result of language change then the reconstruction of the former can be explored by deploying the processes involved in the latter. Their measured arguments and crystal-clear exposition will appeal to all those interested in the evolution of language, from advanced undergraduates to linguists, cognitive scientists, human biologists, and archaeologists.
Readership: All those interested in the evolution of language, from advanced undergraduates to linguists, cognitive scientists, human biologists, psychologists, archaeologists, palaeo-anthropologists. Suitable for use in university courses on language evolution and historical linguistics.

[reviews]

"Heine and Kuteva's The Genesis of Grammar is a major contribution to the rapidly burgeoning literature on the origins and evolution of human language. They draw on their decades of research on the phenomenon of grammaticalization to draw plausible conjectures about what the first human language might have looked like. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fresh perspective on this challenging and fascinating problem." - Frederick J. Newmeyer, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics, University of Washington

"Heine and Kutevas book is a wonderful, illuminating, exhaustive introduction to the subject of language evolution. It affords the reader a wide-ranging, comprehensive overview of the topic and relevant literature. It outlines the core issues, notes the perennial puzzles, and wades boldly into the bitter controversies that have dogged the discussion ever since its inception. Above all, the book reminds us that, however frustrating the topic may be, a true understanding of the phenomenon of language, and thus of human culture and cognition, is only possible within an evolutionary framework." - Talmy Giv{\'o}n, Professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science, University of Oregon},

The cultural intelligence hypothesis argues that this is mainly due to a species-specific set of social-cognitive skills, emerging early in ontogeny, for participating and exchanging knowledge in cultural groups. We tested this hypothesis by giving a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to large numbers of two of humans' closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, as well as to 2.5-year-old human children before literacy and schooling. Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more ``general intelligence,'' we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent developments in semantic theory, such as the work of Labov (1973) and Lakoff (1973), have brought into question the assumption that meanings are precise. It has been proposed that the meanings of all terms are to a lesser or greater degree vague, such that, the boundary of the application of a term is never a point but a region where the term gradually moves from being applicable to nonapplicable.

Developments in fuzzy set theory have made it possible to offer a formal treatment of vagueness of natural language concepts. In this article, the proposition that natural language concepts are represented as fuzzy sets of meaning components and that language operators---adverbs, negative markers, and adjectives--- can be considered as operators on fuzzy sets was assessed empirically. In a series of experiments, we explored the application of fuzzy set theory to the meaning of phrases such as very small, sort of large, and so on.

In Experiment 1, subjects judged the applicability of the set of phrases to a set of squares of varying size. The results indicated that the group interpretation of the phrases can be characterized within the framework of fuzzy set theory. Similar results were obtained in Experiment 2, where each subject's responses were analyzed individually. Although the responses of the subjects, in general, could be interpreted in terms of fuzzy logical operations, one subject responded in a more idiomatic style.

Experiments 3 and 4 were attempts to influence the logical-idiomatic distinction in interpretation by (a) varying the presentation mode of the phrases and by (b) giving subjects only a single phrase to judge.

Overall, the results were consistent with the hypothesis that natural language
concepts and operators can be described the framework of fuzzy set theory.

Third, both overt and covert actions can elicit perceptual simulation of their normal consequences. A large body of evidence supports these assumptions.

  Abstract                 = {This study offers a Construction Grammar approach to the historical development and modern usage of future constructions in English, German, Dutch, Danish, and Swedish. On the basis of corpus data, constructions such as English be going to or German werden are analyzed as symbolic units that convey a range of temporal and modal meanings. A special focus lies on the main verbs that occur with these constructions. Statistical co-occurrence patterns between constructions and lexical items guide the semantic analyses in this study: It is argued that a construction that conventionally occurs with main verbs such as write or speak differs functionally from a construction that typically occurs with verbs such as rain or increase. The same approach is also applied historically: If a construction co-occurs with different main verbs at subsequent stages in time, this is seen as a sign of semantic change.

Like the HSP system, FF relies on forward state space search, using a heuristic that estimates goal distances by ignoring delete lists. Unlike HSP's heuristic, our method does not assume facts to be independent. We introduce a novel search strategy that combines hill-climbing with systematic search, and we show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and used to prune the search space. FF was the most successful automatic planner at the recent AIPS-2000 planning competition. We review the results of the competition, give data for other benchmark domains, and investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of FF compared to HSP.},

  Abstract                 = {Oneof the most important roles a computer can play is to act as a simulator of physical processes. When a computer mimics the behavior of a system, such as the flow of air over an airplane wing, it provides us with a unique way of studying the factors that control that behavior. The key, of course, is for the computer to offer an accurate rendition of the system being studied. In the past fifty years, computers have scored some major successes in this regard. Designers of airplanes, bridges, and America's Cup yachts all use computers routinely to analyze their designs before they commit them tometal. For such artifacts, we know how to mimic the behavior quite exactly, using equations discovered over a century ago. 

However, there are systems of crucial interest to humankind that have so far defied accurate simulation by computer. Economies, ecologies, immune systems, developing embryos, and the barin all exhibit complexities that block broadly based attempts at comprehension. For example, the equation-based methods that work well fo airplanes have a much more limited scope for economies. A finance ministrer cannot expect the same accuracy in asking to play out the impact of a policy change as an engineer can expect in asking the computer to play out the implications of tilting an airplane wing. 

Despite the disparities and the difficulties, we are entering a new era in our ability to understand and foster such systems. The grounds for optimism come from two recent advances. First, scientists have begun to extract a common kernel from these systems: each of the systems involves a similar ''evolving structure''. That is, these systems change and reorganize their component parts to adapt themselves to problems posed by their surroundings. This is the main reason the systems are difficult to understand and controol -- they constitute a ''moving target.'' We are learning, however, that hte mechanisms that mediate these systems are much more alike than surface observations would suggest. These mechanisms and the deeper similarities are important enough that the systems are now grouped under a common name, complex adaptive systems.

  Abstract                 = {[about]
This is a general introduction to grammaticalization, the change whereby lexical terms and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions, and, once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions. The authors synthesize work from several areas of linguistics, including historical linguistics, discourse analysis, and pragmatics. Data are drawn from many languages including Ewe, Finnish, French, Hindi, Hittite, Japanese, Malay, and especially English. This 2003 second edition has been thoroughly revised with substantial updates on theoretical and methodological issues that have arisen in the decade since the first edition, and includes a significantly expanded bibliography. Particular attention is paid to recent debates over directionality in change and the role of grammaticalization in creolization. Grammaticalization will be a valuable and stimulating textbook for all linguists interested in the development of grammatical forms and will also be of interest to readers in anthropology and psychology.

  Abstract                 = {Human language provides, among other things, a mechanism for distinguishing between relevant objects in the natural environment. This mechanism is composed of two components -- forms and meanings -- which must be shared by the community of language users. The lexicon constitutes much of a language's form, but its description as a set of shared form-meaning resources for communication is seldom addressed by formal models of language. This paper presents a simulation model of how shared symbols (form-meaning pairs) can emerge from the interactions of simple cognitive agents in an artificial world. The problem of creating a lexicon from scratch is solved by having cognitive agents capable of organizing themselves internally -- that is, agents which can learn to classify a world of visual phenomena -- share their expressions of visual experience in interaction. The model is seen as an instantiation of a theory of cognition which takes symbols to be a product of inter- and intra-individual organizations of behavior, the result of cultural process.

We first present a theoretical stance which has been derived (elsewhere) from empirical investigation of human cognitive phenomena. This stance leads to the articulation of some simple information-processing constraints which must hold for lexicons and their users. In the middle of the paper, we present two simulations employing communities of simple agents which allow us to model how a lexicon could come into existence or emerge from the interactions between agents in an extremely simple world of experience. The model allows us to explore issues which involve interaction between group- and individual-level properties of cognition, social organization, and communication. Near the end of the paper, we briefly review some findings from the literature on lexicons of natural language. We conclude the paper with an evaluation of the model as an instantiation of the theoretical stance.},

Assuming the existence of such a stage, the present review decomposes the emergence of modern language into nine partially ordered steps, each of which contributes to precision and variety of expression. Bickerton's proposed `protolanguage' falls somewhere in the middle of this succession. In addition to the by-now accepted evidence from language learning, language disorders, and ape language experiments, modern languages provide evidence of these stages of evolution through the presence of detectable `fossils' in vocabulary and grammar.},

  Abstract                 = {Functionalist typologists have long argued that pressures associated with language usage influence the distribution of grammatical properties across the world's languages. Specifically, grammatical properties may be observed more often across languages because they improve a language's utility or decrease its complexity. While this approach to the study of typology offers the potential of explaining grammatical patterns in terms of general principles rather than domain-specific constraints, the notions of utility and complexity are more often grounded in intuition than empirical findings. A suitable empirical foundation might be found in the terms of processing preferences: in that case, psycholin- guistic measures of complexity are then expected correlate with typological patterns. We summarize half a century of psycholinguistic work on `processing complexity' in an attempt to make this work accessible to a broader audience: What makes something hard to process for comprehenders, and what determines speakers' preferences in production? We also briefly discuss recently emerging approaches that link preferences in production to communicative efficiency. These approaches can be seen as providing well-defined measures of utility. With these psycholinguistic findings in mind, it is possible to investigate the extent to which language usage is reflected in typological patterns. We close with a summary of paradigms that allow the link between language usage and typology to be studied empirically. },

These states include not only intending actions that will eventually be executed, but also imagining actions, recognizing tools, learning by observation, or even understanding the behavior of other people. Studies using techniques for mapping brain activity, probing cortical excitability, or measuring the activity of peripheral effectors in normal human subjects and in patients all provide evidence of a subliminal activation of the motor system during these cognitive states. The hypothesis that the motor system is part of a simulation network that is activated under a variety of conditions in relation to action, either self-intended or observed from other individuals, will be developed. The function of this process of simulation would be not only to shape the motor system in anticipation to execution, but also to provide the self with information on the feasibility and the meaning of potential actions.},

The collected evidence on the somatotopic activation of motor areas, abstract and concrete word processing, as well as from reported patient and timing studies emphasizes the important role of sensorimotor areas in language processing and supports the hypothesis that the motor system is activated during language comprehension.},

Associative models assume that people accomplish such cross- situational learning by approximately tracking which words and referents co-occur. However, some researchers posit that learners hypothesize only a single referent for each word, and retain and test this hypothesis unless it is disconfirmed. To compare these two views, we fit two models to individual learning trajectories in a cross-situational word-learning task, in which each trial presents four objects and four spoken words---16 possible word- object pairings per trial. The model that maintains a single hypothesis for each word does not fit as well as the associative model that roughly learns the co-occurrence structure of the data using competing attentional biases for familiar pairings and uncertain stimuli. We conclude that language acquisition is likely supported by memory, not sparse hypotheses.},

However, beside the fact that joint attention has recently received an increasing interest in the robotics communicty, existing models concetnrate only on partiual and isolated elements of these phenomena. In the line of Tomasello's research, we argue that joint attention si much mre tha simultaneous looking because it implies a shared intentional relation to the world. This requires skills for attention detection, attention manipulation, social coordination and, most importantly, intentional understanding. Agter defining joint attention and its challenges, the current state-of-the-art of robotic and computational models relevant for this issue is discussed in relation to a developmental timeline drawn from results in child studies.

In section 3 we discuss several linguistically motivated subclasses of dets. In two cases, classes distinguished by B&C are shown to etend in an enlightening way to the larger class of dets we consider. In a third case, the indefinite dets, we offer an alternative definition which we feel to be simpler and descriptively more adequate. Two new classes are defined in terms of which a second universal is posited. That generalization leads to our second major result: the (In)effability Theorems, which place a certain constraint on the expressive power of English dets.},

These prepositions have different semantics in the viewer-centred and intrinsic frames of reference (Vandeloise, 1991). We define a model of their semantics in each frame of reference. The basis of these models is a novel parameterized continuum function that creates a 3-D spatial template. In the intrinsic frame of reference the origin used by the continuum function is assumed to be known a priori and object occlusion does not impact on the applicability rating of a point in the spatial template. In the viewer-centred frame the location of the spatial template's origin is dependent on the user's perception of the landmark at the time of the utterance and object occlusion is integrated into the model. Where there is an ambiguity with respect to the intended frame of reference, we define an algorithm for merging the spatial templates from the competing frames of reference, based on psycholinguistic observations in (Carlson-Radvansky, 1997).},

  Abstract                 = {The topological prepositions ``at'', ``on'' and ``in'' constitute a fundamental set of prepositions in English. The primary constraint on the applicability of these prepositions is the proximity of the object they locate to the landmark being used. This shared constraint often results in an overlap in their range of applicability. Differentiating between the applicability of these prepositions is a problematic issue requiring recourse to both conceptual (Herskovits 1986) and functional (Coventry and Garrod 2004) information. However, the topological relations that are present in a given spatial configuration may also be important in the applicability of these prepositions. By topological relation (as distinct from topological preposition) we mean the type of relations normally used in topography; for example, relations such as inclusion, touching, overlap, etc. The region connection calculus (RCC) (Cohn et al. 1997) is a well-known framework that abstractly describes the possible topological relations between two regions. There are several region connection calculi distinguished by the number of topological relationships they identify. The best known of the RCC frameworks is RCC-8. RCC-8 distinguishes eight topological relations that are possible between two simple regions without holes in 2D space: DISCONNECTED, EXTERNALLY CONNECTED,EQUAL, PARTIALLY OVERLAPPING, TANGENTIAL PROPER PART, TANGENTIAL PROPER PART INVERSE, NON-TANGENTIAL PROPER PART and NON-TANGENTIAL PROPER PART INVERSE. Moving from 2D to 3D, the complexity in formally modelling topological relationships increases dramatically due to the need to represent more complex object types and identify the relationships between them. For example, the 3D topological framework described in Borrmann et al. (2006) uses four types of objects Point, Line, Surface and Body. Using these four basic object types the framework distinguishes nine different types of topological relationship: DISJOINT, EQUAL, CONTAIN, WITHIN, OVERLAP, TOUCH, MEET, ONBOUNDARY and CROSS.},

We first describe a generic architecture for a visually situated dialog system and highlight the interactions between the spatial cognition module, which provides the interface to the models of prepositional semantics, and the other components in the architecture. Following this, we present two new computational models of topological and projective spatial prepositions. The main novelty within these models is the fact that they account for the contextual effect which other distractor objects in a visual scene can have on the region described by a given preposition. We next present psycholinguistic tests evaluating our approach to distractor interference on prepositional semantics, and illustrate how these models are used for both interpretation and generation of prepositional expressions.},

  Abstract                 = {In the cognitive neuroscience literature on the distinction between categorical and coordinate spatial relations, it has often been observed that categorical spatial relations are referred to linguistically by words like English prepositions, many of which specify binary oppositions---e.g., above/below, left/right, on/off, in/out. However, the actual semantic content of English prepositions, and of comparable word classes in other languages, has not been carefully considered. This paper has three aims. The first and most important aim is to inform cognitive neuroscientists interested in spatial representation about relevant research on the kinds of categorical spatial relations that are encoded in the 6000+ languages of the world. Emphasis is placed on cross-linguistic similarities and differences involving deictic relations, topological relations, and projective relations, the last of which are organized around three distinct frames of reference---intrinsic, relative, and absolute. The second aim is to review what is currently known about the neuroanatomical correlates of linguistically encoded categorical spatial relations, with special focus on the left supramarginal and angular gyri, and to suggest ways in which cross-linguistic data can help guide future research in this area of inquiry. The third aim is to explore the interface between language and other mental systems, specifically by summarizing studies which suggest that although linguistic and perceptual/cognitive representations of space are at least partially distinct, language nevertheless has the power to bring about not only modifications of perceptual sensitivities but also adjustments of cognitive styles.},

  Abstract                 = {English uses the same prepositions to describe both spatial and temporal relationships (e.g., at the corner, at 1:30), and other languages worldwide exhibit similar patterns. These space-time parallelisms have been explained by the Metaphoric Mapping Theory, which maintains that humans have a cognitive predisposition to structure temporal concepts in terms of spatial schemas through the application of a TIME IS SPACE metaphor. Evidence comes from (among other sources) historical investigations showing that languages consistently develop in such a way that expressions that originally have only spatial meanings are gradually extended to take on analogous temporal meanings. It is not clear, however, if the metaphor actively influences the way that modern adults process prepositional meanings during language use. To explore this question, a series of experiments was conducted with four brain-damaged subjects with left perisylvian lesions. Two subjects exhibited the following dissociation: they failed a test that assesses knowledge of the spatial meanings of prepositions, but passed a test that assesses knowledge of the corresponding temporal meanings of the same prepositions. This result suggests that understanding the temporal meanings of prepositions does not necessarily require establishing structural alignments with their spatial correlates. Two other subjects exhibited the opposite dissociation: they performed better on the spatial test than on the temporal test. Overall, these findings support the view that although the spatial and temporal meanings of prepositions are historically linked by virtue of the TIME IS SPACE metaphor, they can be (and may normally be) represented and processed independently of each other in the brains of modern adults.},

  Abstract                 = {A major interest in cognitive science is the relationship between linguistic and perceptual representations of space. One approach to exploring this relationship has been to investigate aspects of the linguistic encoding of space that correspond closely to aspects of the visual system. Another approach, which does not contradict the first but rather complements it, is to investigate ways in which linguistic and visual representations of space are different. This paper pursues the second approach by arguing that the distinction between proximal and distal demonstratives (e.g. this vs. that, here vs. there) does not correspond to an independently established distinction between near and far space in the visual system but is instead based on language-internal factors. Recent neuropsychological and neurophysiological studies suggest that the brain contains separate mechanisms for representing, on the one hand, near or peripersonal space which extends roughly to the perimeter of arm's reach and, on the other hand, far or extrapersonal space which expands outward from that boundary. In addition, crosslinguistic research suggests that it is very common for languages to have two basic types of demonstrative terms -- proximal and distal. This parallelism raises the possibility that the linguistic distinction may derive from the perceptual distinction. However, several arguments support the contrary view that the two distinctions are independent of one another. A substantial proportion of languages in the world have demonstrative systems that divide space into three or more egocentrically-grounded regions, thereby violating the two-way perceptual contrast. Even more importantly, empirical studies of how demonstratives are used in ongoing discourse in different languages suggest that they do not encode quantitative spatial information such as within vs. beyond arm's reach; instead, they specify abstract semantic notions that, when combined with the unique pragmatic features of communicative contexts, allow speakers to make a virtually unlimited range of spatial distance contrasts. Thus, demonstratives constitute an interesting case of divergence between linguistic and perceptual representations of space.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe two patients who manifested opposite patterns of performance on test batteries that evaluated production, comprehension, and semantic analysis of action verbs on the one hand (e.g. smile, wave, run) and locative prepositions on the other (e.g. in, on, over). JP failed all of the verb tests but passed all of the preposition tests, suggesting impaired knowledge of the meanings of action verbs but intact knowledge of the meanings of locative prepositions. In contrast, RR exhibited the reverse dissociation: he passed many of the verb tests but failed all of the preposition tests, suggesting mostly intact knowledge of the meanings of action verbs but impaired knowledge of the meanings of locative prepositions. This behavioral double dissociation reflects the fact that the two categories of words differ along several conceptual parameters. To a large extent, the patients exhibited a neuroanatomical double dissociation as well, since JP's lesion is predominantly in the left frontal operculum whereas RR's is predominantly in the left inferior parietal lobe and the posterior superior temporal region. This constitutes preliminary evidence that the meanings of action verbs and locative prepositions are represented by partially independent neural networks in the brain.

  Abstract                 = {How can we explain the origins of our uniquely human compositional system of communication?1 Much of the recent work tackling this problem (e.g Bickerton 1990; Pinker & Bloom 1990; Newmeyer 1991; Hurford et al. 1998) explicitly attempts to relate models of our innate linguistic endowment with neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. These are essentially functional stories, arguing that the central features of human language are genetically encoded and have emerged over evolutionary time in response to natural selection pressures.
In this paper I put forward a new approach to understanding the origins of some of the key ingredients in a syntactic system. I show, using a computational model, that compositional syntax is an inevitable outcome of the dynamics of observationally learned communication systems. In a simulated population of individuals, language develops from a simple idiosyncratic vocabulary with little expressive power, to a compositional system with high expressivity, nouns and verbs, and word order expressing meaning distinctions.2 This happens without natural selection of learners - indeed, without any biological change at all - any notion of function being built into the system.
This approach does not deny the possibility that much of our linguistic ability may be explained in terms of natural selection, but it does highlight the fact that biological evolution is by no means the only powerful adaptive system at work in the origins of human language.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the literatures on human spatial cognition and animal navigation often make distinctions between egocentric and allocentric (also called exocentric or geocentric) representations, the terms have not generally been well defined. This chapter begins by making formal distinctions between three kinds of representations: allocentric locational, egocentric locational, and allocentric heading representations. These distinctions are made in the context of whole-body navigation (as contrasted, e.g., with manipulation).They are made on the basis of primitive parameters specified by each representation, and the representational distinctions are further supported by work on brain mechanisms used for animal navigation.From the assumptions about primitives, further inferences are made as to the kind of information each representation potentially makes available. Empirical studies of how well people compute primitive and derived spatial parameters are briefly reviewed. Finally, the chapter addresses what representations humans may use for processing spatial information during physical and imagined movement, and work on imagined updating of spatial position is used to constrain the connectivity among representations.},

We examined consolidation and interference to determine if these two forms of learning were independent. Learning and consolidation of two novel transformations, a rotated spatial reference frame and altered intersegmental dynamics, did not interfere with each other and consolidated in parallel. Thus separate kinematic and dynamic models were constructed simultaneously based on errors computed in different coordinate frames, and possibly, in different sensory modalities, using separate working-memory systems. These results suggest that computational approaches to motor learning should include two separate performance errors rather than one.},

The underlying assumption is that to understand situated dialogue, communicated meaning needs to be related to the situation(s) it refers to. The model couples incremental processing to a notion of bidirectional connectivity, inspired by how humans process visually situated language. Analyzing an utterance in a ''word-by-word, left-to-right'' fashion, a representation of possible utterance interpretations is gradually built up. In a top-down fashion, the model tries to ground these interpretations in models the robot maintains of situations, through which they can prime what is focused on in a situation. In a bottom-up fashion, the (im)possibility to ground certain interpretations primes how the analysis of the utterance further unfolds. The article discusses the implementation of the model in a distributed, cognitive architecture for human-robot interaction, and presents an evaluation on a test suite.},

  Abstract                 = {ALCOVE (attention learning covering map) is a connectionist model of category learning that incorporates an exemplar-based representation (Medin & Schaffer, 1978; Nosofsky, 1986) with error-driven learning (Gluck & Bower, 1988; Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986). Alcove selectively attends to relevant stimulus dimensions, is sensitive to correlated dimensions, can account for a form of base-rate neglect, does not suffer catastrophic forgetting, and can exhibit 3-stage (U-shaped) learning of high-frequency exceptions to rules, whereas such effects are not easily accounted for by models using other combinations of representation and learning method.

The main claims made are that
i. the use of the posture-verb construction as an aspectual marker corre- lates with the use of the posture verbs as the UNMARKED/CANONCIAL ENCODINGS OF SPATIAL POSITION OF OBJECTS;
ii. the tendency for a language to encode the spatial position of an entity in terms of the notions of sitting, or standing, or lying elevates the corre- sponding verb structures to the status of basic, most common verb expres- sions and thus makes them appropriate source structures in auxiliation.},

  Abstract                 = {I view cognitive linguistics as defined by the commitment to characterize the full range of linguistic generalizations while being faithful to empirical discoveries about the nature of the mind/brain. The Invariance Hypothesis is a proposed general principle intended to characterize a broad range or regularities in both our conceptual and linguistic Systems. Given that all metaphorical mappings are partial, the Invariance Hypothesis claims that the portion of the source domain structure that is mapped preserves cognitive topology (though, of course, not all the cognitive topology ofthe source domain need be mapped). Since the cognitive topology of Image-Schemas determines their inference patterns, the Invariance Hypothesis claims that imagistic reasoning patterns are mapped onto abstract reasoning patterns via metaphorical mappings. It entails that at least some (and perhaps all) abstract reasoning is a metaphorical version of image-based reasoning. The data covered by the Invariance Hypothesis includes the metaphorical understanding of time, states, events, actions, purposes, means, causes, modalities, linear scales, and categories. Because the source domains of these metaphorical concepts are structured by image-schemas, the Invariance Hypothesis suggests that reasoning involving these concepts is fundamentally image-based. This includes the subject matter of Boolean, scalar, modal, temporal, and causal reasoning. These cases cover such a large range of abstract reasoning that the question naturally arises as to whether all abstract human reasoning is a metaphorical version of imagistic reasoning. I see this as a major question for future research in cognitive linguistics.},

Cognitive grammar takes a nonstandard view of linguistic semantics and grammatical structure. Meaning is equated with conceptualization. Semantic structures are characterized relative to cognitive domains, and derive their value by construing the content of these domains in a specific fashion. Grammar is not a distinct level of linguistic representation, but reduces instead to the structuring and symbolization of conceptual content. All grammatical units are symbolic: Basic categories (e.g., noun and verb) are held to be nationally definable, and grammatical rules are analyzed as symbolic units that are both complex and schematic. These concepts permit a revealing account of grammatical composition with notable descriptive advantages.},

One of the less rewarding of our common interdisciplinary pursuits is lifting theoretical concepts from subjects not our own, and using them in contexts very distant from thosethey were intended for. Such borrowings often turn from theoretical claims into sloppy metaphors, leading to varieties of 'vulgar X-ism', the result of overenthusiastiac appropriation within sufficient sense of the subtlety or precise applicability of the originals.Spencer's 'Social Darwinism', vulgar-Freudian or vulgar-Marxist literary analysis and sociology are nice examples. Linguistics,being less unique than linguists often think, is no exception: Praguian and neo-Praguian functionalism may be a kind of vulgar Darwinism, extending notions of 'adaptation' or 'selective pressure' to the inappropriate domain of language systems (see Lass, 1980a). But everyonce in a while such transfers seem to work, like Darwin's borrowings from late eighteenth century Scottish economic theory; if not always through direct applicability, then by focusing on new ways of interpreting old data, or providing a basis for linking disparate phenomena as instances of a new (putative) natural kind.},

The results suggest that the previous assumption of scale invariance in spatial language is incorrect. The physical world as experienced by humans, and described by human language, is not a fractal: scale appears to change its very physical nature, and hence the meaning of its spatial relations. The experiment demonstrated how scale influences preposition use, and how different preposit- ions appeared to evoke different levels of acceptability in themselves. Context, in terms of object type (solid or liquid), interacted with these factors to demonstrate specific constraints upon spatial language use. The results are discussed in terms of figure-ground relations, as well as the role of human experience and the classification of the world into 'objects' in different ways at different scales. Since this was a preliminary and artificially-constrained experiment, the need for further research is emphasized.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel method for detecting and localizing objects
of a visual category in cluttered real-world scenes. Our approach
considers object categorization and figure-ground segmentation as
two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common
goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two
processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the
combined performance. The core part of our approach is a highly flexible
learned representation for object shape that can combine the information
observed on different training examples in a probabilistic extension
of the Generalized Hough Transform. The resulting approach can detect
categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic
segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then
in turn used to again improve recognition by allowing the system
to focus its efforts on object pixels and to discard misleading influences
from the background. Moreover, the information from where in the
image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based
hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping
hypotheses and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.},

He presents four arguments for biological innateness of psychological capacities, parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits:
Universal appearance of a trait at a single time across a species. "Species typical" traits.
Universal appearance across time for a group. Not just an artifact of cultural history. Again, "species typical" diagnostic feature.
No learning of the trait is possible.
Individual development of a trait rigidly follows a given schedule regardless of the particular experience of the organism.

  Abstract                 = {￼Making a self-repair in speech typically proceeds in three phases. The first phase involves the monitoring of one's own speech and the interruption of the flow of speech when trouble is detected. From an analysis of 959 spontaneous self-repairs it appears that interrupting follows detection promptly, with the exception that correct words tend to be completed. Another finding is that detection of trouble improves towards the end of constituents. The second phase is characterized by hesitation,pausing, but especially the use of so-called editing terms. Which editing term is used depends on the nature of the speech trouble in a rather regular fashion: Speech errors induce other editing terms than words thatare merely inappropriate, and trouble which is detected quickly by the speaker is preferably signalled by the use of `uh'. The third phase consistsof making the repairproper. The linguistic well-formedness of a repair is not dependent on the speaker's respecting the integriv of constituents, but on the structural relation between original utterance and repair. A bi-conditional well-formedness rule links this relation to a corresponding relation between the conjuncts of a coordination. It is suggested that a similar relation holds also between question and answer. In all three cases the speaker respects certain Istructuralcommitments derived from an original utterance. It was finally shown that the editing term plus the first word of the repair proper almost alwayscontain sufficient informationfor the listener to decide how the repair should be related to the original utterance. Speakers almost never produce misleading information in this respect. It is argued that speakers have littleor no access to their speech production process; self-monitoring is probably based on parsing one's own inner or overt speech.},

There has been much concern with the symbolism of space in athropological writings, but little on concepts of space in practical activities. This neglect of everyday spatial notions may be due to unwitting ethnocentricsm, the assumtion in Western thinking generally that notions of space are universially of a single kind. Recent work shows that systems of spatial reckoning and descriptions can in fact be quite divergent across cultures, linguistic differences correlating wiht distinct cognitive tendencies. This unexpected cultural variation raises interesting questions concerning the relation between cultural and linguistic concepts and the biological foundations of cognition. It argues for more sophisticated models relating culture and cognition than we currently have available.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that the language sciences are on the brink of major changes in primary data, methods and theory. Reactions to `The myth of language universals' (Evans and Levinson, 2009a,b) divide in response to these new challenges. Chomskyan-inspired 'C- linguists' defend a status quo, based on intuitive data and disparate universalizing abstract frameworks, reflecting 30 years of changing models. Linguists driven by interests in richer data and linguistic diversity, 'D-linguists', though more responsive to the new developments, have tended to lack an integrating framework. Here we outline such an integrative framework of the kind we were presupposing in 'Myth', namely a coevolutionary model of the interaction between mind and cultural linguistic traditions which puts variation central at all levels -- a model that offers the right kind of response to the new challenges. In doing so we traverse the fundamental questions raised by the commentary in this special issue: What constitutes the data, what is the place of formal representations, how should linguistic comparison be done, what counts as explanation, what is the source of design in language?
Radical changes in data, methods and theory are upon us. The future of the discipline will depend on responses to these changes: either the field turns in on itself and atrophies, or it modernizes, and tries to capitalize on the way language lies at the intersection of all the disciplines interested in human nature.},

Li and Gleitman (Turning the tables: language and spatial reasoning. Cognition, in press) seek to undermine a large-scale cross-cultural comparison of spatial language and cognition which claims to have demonstrated that language and conceptual coding in the spatial domain covary (see, for example, Space in language and cognition: explorations in linguistic diversity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, in press; Language 74 (1998) 557): the most plausible interpretation is that different languages induce distinct conceptual codings. Arguing against this, Li and Gleitman attempt to show that in an American student population they can obtain any of the relevant conceptual codings just by varying spatial cues, holding language constant. They then argue that our findings are better interpreted in terms of ecologically-induced distinct cognitive styles reflected in language. Linguistic coding, they argue, has no causal effects on non-linguistic thinking - it simply reflects antecedently existing conceptual distinctions. We here show that Li and Gleitman did not make a crucial distinction between frames of spatial reference relevant to our line of research. We report a series of experiments designed to show that they have, as a consequence, misinterpreted the results of their own experiments, which are in fact in line with our hypothesis. Their attempts to reinterpret the large cross-cultural study, and to enlist support from animal and infant studies, fail for the same reasons. We further try to discern exactly what theory drives their presumption that language can have no cognitive efficacy, and conclude that their position is undermined by a wide range of considerations.},

  Abstract                 = {Language communities differ in their stock of reference frames (coordinate systems for specifying locations and directions). English typically uses egocentrically-defined axes (e.g., ``left--right''), especially when describing small-scale relationships. Other languages such as Tseltal Mayan prefer to use geocentrically-defined axes (e.g., ``north--south'') and do not use any type of projective body-defined axes. It has been argued that the availability of specific frames of reference in language determines the availability or salience of the corresponding spatial concepts. In four experiments, we explored this hypothesis by testing Tseltal speakers' spatial reasoning skills. Whereas most prior tasks in this domain were open-ended (allowing several correct solutions), the present tasks required a unique solution that favored adopting a frame-of-reference that was either congruent or incongruent with what is habitually lexicalized in the participants' language. In these tasks, Tseltal speakers easily solved the language-incongruent problems, and performance was generally more robust for these than for the language-congruent problems that favored geocentrically-defined coordinates. We suggest that listeners' probabilistic inferences when instruction is open to more than one interpretation account for why there are greater cross-linguistic differences in the solutions to open-ended spatial problems than to less ambiguous ones.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates possible influences of the lexical resources of individual languages on the spatial organization and reasoning styles of their users. That there are such powerful and pervasive influences of language on thought is the thesis of the Whorf--Sapir linguistic relativity hypothesis which, after a lengthy period in intellectual limbo, has recently returned to prominence in the anthropological, linguistic, and psycholinguistic literatures. Our point of departure is an influential group of cross-linguistic studies that appear to show that spatial reasoning is strongly affected by the spatial lexicon in everyday use in a community (e.g. Brown, P., & Levinson, S. C. (1993). Linguistic and nonlinguistic coding of spatial arrays: explorations in Mayan cognition (Working Paper No. 24). Nijmegen: Cognitive Anthropology Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics; Cognitive Linguistics 6 (1995) 33). Specifically, certain groups customarily use an externally referenced spatial-coordinate system to refer to nearby directions and positions (``to the north'') whereas English speakers usually employ a viewer-perspective system (``to the left''). Prior findings and interpretations have been to the effect that users of these two types of spatial system solve rotation problems in different ways, reasoning strategies imposed by habitual use of the language- particular lexicons themselves. The present studies reproduce these different problem-solving strategies in speakers of a single language (English) by manipulating landmark cues, suggesting that language itself may not be the key causal factor in choice of spatial perspective. Prior evidence on rotation problem solution from infants (e.g. Acredolo, L.P. (1979). Laboratory versus home: the effect of environment on the 9-month-old infant's choice of spatial reference system. Developmental Psychology, 15 (6), 666--667) and from laboratory animals (e.g. Restle, F. (1975). Discrimination of cues in mazes: a resolution of the place-vs.-response question. Psychological Review, 64, 217--228) suggests a unified interpretation of the findings: creatures approach spatial problems differently depending on the availability and suitability of local landmark cues. The results are discussed in terms of the current debate on the relation of language to thought, with particular emphasis on the question of why different cultural communities favor different perspectives in talking about space.},

This paper elucidates the main reasons and key motivations behind the convergence of fields with seemingly disparate interests, and shows why developmental robotics might prove to be beneficial for all fields involved. The methodology advocated is synthetic and two-pronged: on the one hand, it employs robots to instantiate models originating from developmental sciences; on the other hand, it aims to develop better robotic systems by exploiting insights gained from studies on ontogenetic development. This paper gives a survey of the relevant research issues and points to some future research directions.},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of humanoid robots has enabled a new approach to investigating the acquisition of language, and we report on the development of robots able to acquire rudimentary linguistic skills. Our work focuses on early stages analogous to some characteristics of a human child of about 6 to 14 months, the transition from babbling to first word forms. We investigate one mechanism among many that may contribute to this process, a key factor being the sensitivity of learners to the statistical distribution of linguistic elements. As well as being necessary for learning word meanings, the acquisition of anchor word forms facilitates the segmentation of an acoustic stream through other mechanisms. In our experiments some salient one-syllable word forms are learnt by a humanoid robot in real-time interactions with naive participants. Words emerge from random syllabic babble through a learning process based on a dialogue between the robot and the human participant, whose speech is perceived by the robot as a stream of phonemes. Numerous ways of representing the speech as syllabic segments are possible. Furthermore, the pronunciation of many words in spontaneous speech is variable. However, in line with research elsewhere, we observe that salient content words are more likely than function words to have consistent canonical representations; thus their relative frequency increases, as does their influence on the learner. Variable pronunciation may contribute to early word form acquisition. The importance of contingent interaction in real-time between teacher and learner is reflected by a reinforcement process, with variable success. The examination of individual cases may be more informative than group results. Nevertheless, word forms are usually produced by the robot after a few minutes of dialogue, employing a simple, real-time, frequency dependent mechanism. This work shows the potential of human-robot interaction systems in studies of the dynamics of early language acquisition.},

This analysis will contribute further by describing the Zapotec system and by comparing it to those of Mixtec and Trique.

By giving clear cues to our listeners about which perspectives they should assume and how they should move from one perspective to the next, we maximize the extent to which they can share our perceptions and ideas. When language is rich in cues for perspective taking and perspective shifting, it awakens the imagination of the listener and leads to successful sharing of ideas, impressions, attitudes, and narratives. When the process of perspective sharing is disrupted by interruptions, monotony, excessive complexity, or lack of shared knowledge, communication can break down.},

Such results have been interpreted as indicating that concepts, and important aspects of cognition more broadly, are embodied. That conclusion does not follow from the empirical evidence. The reason why is that the empirical evidence can equally be accommodated by a `disembodied' view of conceptual representation that makes explicit assumptions about spreading activation between the conceptual and sensory and motor systems. At the same time, the strong form of the embodied cognition hypothesis is at variance with currently available neuropsychological evidence. We suggest a middle ground between the embodied and disembodied cognition hypotheses -- grounding by interaction. This hypothesis combines the view that concepts are, at some level, `abstract' and `symbolic', with the idea that sensory and motor information may `instantiate' online conceptual processing.},

Based on the view that language is a mapping between form and meaning, we propose that a theory of language acquisition must be tightly integrated with a theory of the infant's prelinguistic representations. Namely, the infant's task is to learn how to map the linguistic form in the input to her representations of the corresponding scenes. We have developed a theory of prelinguistic cognition based on i) what is currently known about the architecture of the brain, and ii) the representational requirements for successful (sensorimotor) behavior in the world. We show how such prelinguistic sensorimotor representations can provide the basis for the acquisition of early grammatical forms, and thereby ground language in the world. Importantly, this is true not only at the lexical level, but also at the grammatical level.},

  Abstract                 = {How do people describe the location of a target object to another? This task requires a reference object or frame and terms of reference. Traditional linguistic analyses have loosely organized perspectives around people, objects, or environments as reference objects, using reference terms based on a viewpoint or the intrinsic sides of an object, such as left, right, front, and back or based on the environment, such as north, south, east, and west. In actual communication, social, spatial, and cognitive factors may also affect perspective choice. We examine those factors by varying the spatial information (landmarks and cardinal directions), the communication task (relative cognitive burden to speakers and addressees), and the culture of participants (American and Japanese). Speakers used addressees' perspectives more when addressees had the greater cognitive burden. They also used landmarks and cardinal directions when they were available, especially to avoid difficult discriminations like left/right. Some cases appearing to be perspective taking can be interpreted as using a person as a landmark. Finally, terms like near indicating close proximity were preferred to far and to terms requiring projection of directions. Globally, perspective choices of American and Japanese samples were strikingly similar; that is, Japanese did not select addressees' perspectives more than Americans. The traditional linguistic analyses need to be enhanced to account for effects of cognitive, situational, and social factors.},

The authors have suggested that the need to establish reference in communication also influences category coherence. This proposal was tested in 2 studies involving a referential communica- tion task. In these studies, consistency was promoted between individuals by communication, which synchronized the category structures of different people. Further, people were focused on the commonalities of objects and on the differences related to the commonalities by communication--a pattern that is compatible with what has been observed in existing categories. These results suggest that categorization research must incorporate communication tasks into the canon of methodologies used to study category structure.},

  Abstract                 = {We suggest that human culture exhibits key Darwinian evolutionary properties, and argue that the structure of a science of cultural evolution should share fundamental features with the structure of the science of biological evolution. This latter claim is tested by outlining the methods and approaches employed by the principal subdisciplines of evolutionary biology and assessing whether there is an existing or potential corresponding approach to the study of cultural evolution. Existing approaches within anthropology and archaeology demonstrate a good match with the macroevolutionary methods of systematics, paleobiology, and biogeography, whereas mathematical models derived from population genetics have been successfully developed to study cultural microevolution. Much potential exists for experimental simulations and field studies of cultural microevolution, where there are opportunities to borrow further methods and hypotheses from biology. Potential also exists for the cultural equivalent of molecular genetics in ``social cognitive neuroscience,'' although many fundamental issues have yet to be resolved. It is argued that studying culture within a unifying evolutionary framework has the potential to integrate a number of separate disciplines within the social sciences.},

Simulation is assumed to use the same sensory--motor systems that are engaged during real experience; when this principle is applied to the representation of linguistic meaning (semantics) theories propose that semantic content is achieved by recreating, usually in weaker form, the sensory and motor information produced when the referent of a word or sentence is actually experienced. Simulations are content-specific; for example, words referring to motion, such as rise and fall, are thought to recruit sensory systems involved in perceiv- ing motion, and words referring to motor actions, such as kick and walk, are thought to recruit the motor systems used for those actions.},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge in studying social behaviour stems from the need to disentangle the behaviour of each individual from the resulting collective. One way to overcome this problem is to construct a model of the behaviour of an individual, and observe whether combining many such individuals leads to the predicted outcome. This can be achieved by using robots. In this review we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach for studies of social behaviour. We find that robots---whether studied in groups of simulated or physical robots, or used to infiltrate and manipulate groups of living organisms---have important advantages over conventional individual-based models and have contributed greatly to the study of social behaviour. In particular, robots have increased our understanding of self-organization and the evolution of cooperative behaviour and communication. However, the resulting findings have not had the desired impact on the biological community. We suggest reasons for why this may be the case, and how the benefits of using robots can be maximized in future research on social behaviour.},

As a step in this direction, we present a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games by example. The training data consists of textual human commentaries on Robocup simulation games. A set of possible alternative meanings for each comment is automatically constructed from game event traces. Our previously developed systems for learning to parse and generate natural language (KRISP and WASP) were augmented to learn from this data and then commentate novel games. Using this approach, the system has learned to sportscast in both English and Korean. The system has been evaluated based on its ability to properly match sentences to the events being described, parse sentences into correct meanings, and generate accurate linguistic descriptions of events. Human evaluation was also conducted on the overall quality of the generated sportscasts and compared to human-generated commentaries, demonstrating that its sportscasts are on par with those generated by humans.},

Our findings show that spatial reference in human-robot interaction differs from natural situations in human-human interaction in several resects. For instance, many users unexpectedly employed fine-grained, path-based, instructions rather than specifying the intended goal object of the action directly. If instructions were not successful, participants created less and less complex descriptions. Those users who did specify the goal object were found to employ those kinds of spatial reference strategies implemented in our computational model. In particular, they exploited the presence of several similar objects by perceiving and referring to the, linguistically as a group.},
  Annote                   = {aim: human robot interaction in action (drive to a specific location/object)

experimental results:
* ONLY half the participants used goal object description strategy [fahre zum linke wuerfel]
* other strategies 1) path [1 meter geradaus, dann 2 meter links...] 2) action [drehe das hintere rad]
* group-based reference occurs often
* speakers adapt by reducing linguistic complexity (simpler lexicon, less morphology, use of infinitives
* speakers almost exclusively used robot's perspective (also expressively asked for the robot's front)

total 183 instructions:
* 102/183 group based reference
* 69/102 used particular expression scheme
* 19/43 cardbox was used as reference object

quotes:
"Thus, the issue at hand is, 'Which of these similar objects do you refer to?'. This perspective triggers ways of linguistic reference hitherto largely ignored in the literature on spatial reference systems" (pp 3)

It permits differentiations which are useful in realistic application scenarios that cannot directly be dealt with in coarser calculi. There is a price to pay for the advanced options: useful mathematical results for coarser calculi do not hold for the new calculus. This tradeoff is demonstrated by a direct comparison of the new calculus with the flip-flop calculus.},

The linguistic analysis points to the striking variability in speakers' spontaneous strategies and preferences, and it motivates a number of modifications of the computational model.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-intuitive styles of interaction between humans and mobile robots still constitute a major barrier to the wider application and acceptance of mobile robot technology. More natural interaction can only be achieved if ways are found of bridging the gap between the forms of spatial knowledge maintained by such robots and the forms of language used by humans to communicate such knowledge. In this paper, we present the beginnings of a computational model for representing spatial knowledge that is appropriate for interaction between humans and mobile robots. Work on spatial reference in human-human communication has established a range of reference systems adopted when referring to objects; we show the extent to which these strategies transfer to the human-robot situation and touch upon the problem of differing perceptual systems. Our results were obtained within an implemented kernel system which permitted the performance of experiments with human test subjects interacting with the system. We show how the results of the experiments can be used to improve the adequacy and the coverage of the system, and highlight necessary directions for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {From the perspective of cognitive robotics, this paper presents a modern interpretation of Newell's (1973) reasoning and suggestions for why and how cognitive psychologists should develop models of cognitive phenomena. We argue that the shortcomings of current cognitive modelling approaches are due in significant part to a lack of exactly the kind of integration required for the development of embodied autonomous robotics. Moreover we suggest that considerations of embodiment, situatedness, and autonomy, intrinsic to cognitive robotics, provide an appropriate basis for the integration and theoretic cumulation that Newell argued was necessary for psychology to mature. From this perspective we analyse the role of embodiment and modes of situatedness in terms of integration, cognition, emotion, and autonomy. Four complementary perspectives on embodied and situated cognitive science are considered in terms of their potential to contribute to cognitive robotics, cognitive science, and psychological theorizing: minimal cognition and organization, enactive perception and sensorimotor contingency, homeostasis and emotion, and social embedding. In combination these perspectives provide a framework for cognitive robotics, not only wholly compatible with the original aims of cognitive modelling, but as a more appropriate methodology than those currently in common use within psychology.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive research on metaphoric concepts of time has focused on differences between moving Ego and moving time models, but even more basic is the contrast between Ego- and temporal-reference-point models. Dynamic models appear to be quasi-universal cross-culturally, as does the generalization that in Ego-reference-point models, FUTURE IS IN FRONT OF EGO and PAST IS IN BACK OF EGO. The Aymara language instead has a major static model of time wherein FUTURE IS BEHIND EGO and PAST IS IN FRONT OF EGO; linguistic and gestural data give strong confirmation of this unusual culture-specific cognitive pattern. Gestural data provide crucial information unavailable to purely linguistic analysis, suggesting that when investigating conceptual systems both forms of expression should be analyzed complementarily. Important issues in embodied cognition are raised: how fully shared are bodily grounded motivations for universal cognitive patterns, what makes a rare pattern emerge, and what are the cultural entailments of such patterns?},

The studies all used a task in which participants rated the appropriateness of quantifers describing the number of balls in a bowl. The size of the balls was found to have an effect: Identical numbers of balls were given different ratings depending on ball size. It was also found that quantifers were rated as more appropriate when the balls were in their natural functional relationship with the bowl (i.e., contained within the bowl), than when the functional relationship was breached (i.e., the balls overflowed the bowl). Tilting the bowl had surprising effects in that it led to some quantifers being rated as more appropriate. The results are inter- preted as indicating that quantifers carry little specifc meaning in themselves but instead derive their meaning from the context in which they occur.},

The central result is a coherence threshold, which specifies the condition for a universal grammar to induce coherent communication within a population. We study selection of grammars within the same universal grammar and competition between different universal grammars. We calculate the condition under which natural selection favors the emergence of rule-based, generative grammars that underlie complex language.},

We assume that successful communication contributes to biological fittness: individuals who communicate well leave more offspring. Children inherit from their parents a strategy for language learning (a language acquisition device). We consider three mechanisms whereby language is passed from one generation to the next: (i) parental learning: children learn the language of their parents; (ii) role model learning: children learn the language of individuals with a high payo!; and (iii) random learning: children learn the language of randomly chosen individuals. We show that parental and role model learning outperform random learning. Then we introduce mistakes in language learning and study how this process changes language over time. Mistakes increase the overall efficacy of parental and role model learning: in a world with errors evolutionary adaptation is more efficient. Our model also provides a simple explanation why homonomy is common while synonymy is rare.},

  Abstract                 = {The physical world and the language that we use to describe it are full of structure. Very young children discover this structure with apparent ease. They somehow transform sensory information gathered while exploring their environment into knowledge that enables both successful planning and natural language communication, two of the defining characteristics of human intelligence. How might robots autonomously discover similarly useful structure in their sensor data? This dissertation describes a single computational model that accounts for the unsupervised discovery of both the fundamental units of natural languages---words and their meanings---and the fundamental units of plans---actions and their effects. At the core of the model is an algorithm called PERUSE that discovers recurring patterns in real-valued, multivariate time series. Given a set of time series containing acoustic data from spoken utterances, PERUSE discovers patterns that correspond to recurring words. Once the robot discovers words, a second algorithm makes it possible for the denotations of words to be learned from non-auditory sensor data about the robot's environment. The end result is a set of word/meaning pairs that allow the robot to make probabilistic judgments about the referents of words that it hears and about the chances of communicative success when using a word to describe its environment. When these algorithms are applied to sensor data collected while taking actions, the patterns discovered by PERUSE represent possible effects. The end result is a set of action/effect pairs that allow the robot to make probabilistic predictions about the results of taking actions from particular regions of continuous action spaces. ^ The results of two sets of experiments are described. In the first, human subjects played with blocks in front of a robot and generated unrestricted natural language utterances to describe the blocks and their configurations. The system successfully discovered words and their denotations in three different languages---English, German and Mandarin Chinese. In the second experiment the robot sampled actions randomly from a continuous action space that determined its path of motion with respect to objects in its environment. The robot successfully discovered qualitatively distinct interactions as well as regions in its action space that reliably led to the various interactions. ^},

  Abstract                 = {A Saussurean communication system exists when an entire communicating population uses a single 'language' that maps states unambiguously onto symbols and then back into the original states. This paper describes a number of simulations performed with a genetic algorithm to investigate the conditions necessary for such communication systems to evolve. The first simulation shows that Saussurean communication evolves in the simple case where direct selective pressure is placed on individuals to be both good transmitters and good receivers. The second simulation demonstrates that, in the more realistic case where selective pressure is only placed on doing well as a receiver, Saussurean communication fails to evolve. Two methods, inspired by research on the Prisoner's Dilemma, are used to attempt to solve this problem. The third simulation shows that, even in the absence of selective pressure on transmission, Saussurean communication can evolve if individuals interact multiple times with the same communication partner and are given the ability to respond differentially based on past interaction. In the fourth simulation, spatially organized populations are used, and it is shown that this allows Saussurean communication to evolve through kin selection.},

The osteology of Archaeopteryx, in virtually every detail,is indistinguishable from that of contemporaneous and succeeding coelurosaurian dinosaurs - especially in the details of the manus, forelimbs, and pectoral arch. It is proposed that these conditions reflect a highly predaceous mode of life for Archaeopteryx, rather than being arboreal adaptations. Plumage, in the form of contour feathers, is believed to have arisen in response to the need for controlling heatloss (and gain) and was secondarily modified on the forelimbs to enhance the prey - catching function of the hands. Enlargement of the primordial "primaries"and "secondaries" transformed the forelimbs of "proto-Archaeopteryx" into large, continuous, trapping surfaces - natural insect nets -activated by powerful ventral adductor muscles (thepectoraligsroup). These adaptations were admirably preadaptiv feoractive, flapping flight. The primordial insulative function of contour feathers and th epredatory hypothesis for the enlargement of the remige seem to account for the otherwise paradoxical presence in Archaeopteryx of essentially modern "flight" feathers in the absence of virtually all of the skeletal specializations that are associated with (or required for?) modern bird flight, whereas those skeletal specializations that are present in Archaeopteryx are thes ame, or nearly the same, as those that are preserved invarious (presumed ) predaceous coelurosaurian dinosaurs.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals have many different motivations and they must decide which of their different motivations they should try at any given time to satisfy with their behavior. Emotions are states of an individual‚ body and brain that allow the motivational decision mechanism of the individual to function more properly, that is, in ways that increase the individual‚ survival and reproductive chances. The article describes five different simulated robots which, unlike current emotional robots, can be said to have emotions. The robots may need to eat and drink, eat and fly away from a predator, eat and find a mating partner, eat and take care of their offspring, or eat and rest in order to heal from physical damage. We show that adding a special emotional circuit to the neural network controlling the robots behavior leads to better motivational decisions, and therefore to higher fitness, and we describe how in many circumstances the robots endowed with an emotional circuit behave differently than those lacking the circuit. We conclude by indicating various directions of future research.},

I also point out that the general demise of learning is uncontroversial in the biological sciences, while a similar consensus has not yet been reached in psychology and in linguistics at large. Since many arguments presently offered in defense of learning and in defense of "general intelligence" are often based on a distorted picture of human biological evolution, I devote some sections of this paper to a critique of "adaptationism," providing also a sketch of a better evolutionary theory (one based on "exaptation"). Moreover, since certain standard arguments presented today as "knock-down" in psychology, in linguistics and in artificial intelligence are a perfect replica of those once voiced.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},

This claim might seem to be any- one's first guess about the evolutionary status of language, and the default prediction from a Darwinian perspective on human psychological abilities. But the theory has proved to be controversial, as shown by the commentaries in Pinker and Bloom (1990) and the numerous debates on language evolution since then (Fitch 2002; Hurford et al. 1998).
In the chapter I will discuss the design of the language faculty, the theory that language is an adaptation, alternatives to the theory, an examination of what language might an adaptation for, and how the theory is being tested by new kinds of analyses and evidence.},

Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the ``cognitive niche.'' This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.},

Chomsky and Gould have suggested that language may have evolved as the by-product of selection for other abilities or as a consequence of as-yet unknown laws of growth and form. Others have argued that a biological specialization for grammar is incompatible with every tenet of Darwinian theory -- that it shows no genetic variation, could not exist in any intermediate forms, confers no selective advantage, and would require more evolutionary time and genomic space than is available. We examine these arguments and show that they depend on inaccurate assumptions about biology or language or both. Evolutionary theory offers clear criteria for when a trait should be attributed to natural selection: complex design for some function, and the absence of alternative processes capable of explaining such complexity. Human language meets this criterion: grammar is a complex mechanism tailored to the transmission of propositional structures through a serial interface. Autonomous and arbitrary grammatical phenomena have been offered as counterexamples to the position that language is an adaptation, but this reasoning is unsound: communication protocols depend on arbitrary conventions that are adaptive as long as they are shared. Consequently, language acquisition in the child should systematically differ from language evolution in the species and attempts to analogize them are misleading. Reviewing other arguments and data, we conclude that there is every reason to believe that a specialization for grammar evolved by a conventional neo-Darwinian process.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the question of which aspects of language are uniquely human and uniquely linguistic in light of recent suggestions by Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch that the only such aspect is syntactic recursion, the rest of language being either specific to humans but not to language (e.g. words and concepts) or not specific to humans (e.g. speech perception). We find the hypothesis problematic. It ignores the many aspects of grammar that are not recursive, such as phonology, morphology, case, agreement, and many properties of words. It is inconsistent with the anatomy and neural control of the human vocal tract. And it is weakened by experiments suggesting that speech perception cannot be reduced to primate audition, that word learning cannot be reduced to fact learning, and that at least one gene involved in speech and language was evolutionarily selected in the human lineage but is not specific to recursion. The recursion-only claim, we suggest, is motivated by Chomsky's recent approach to syntax, the Minimalist Program, which de-emphasizes the same aspects of language. The approach, however, is sufficiently problematic that it cannot be used to support claims about evolution. We contest related arguments that language is not an adaptation, namely that it is ``perfect,'' non-redundant, unusable in any partial form, and badly designed for},

In one classic paradigm, presented in a seminal article by Mark Gold 1967, a learning procedure is taken to be an algorithm running an infinite loop on a never-ending stream of inputs. The inputs are grammatical strings chosen from a target language in a known class of languages. That language has to be identified by choosing a grammar for it from a known set of grammars. At each point in the process, any string in the language might be the next string that turns up (strings can turn up repeatedly). After each input the algorithm produces a guess at the grammar. Success in identifying a language consists of eventually guessing a grammar that is correct ...},

There is now a wealth of empirical evidence demonstrating changes in cortical topography in primated following deafferentation or amputation, and this review will attempt to relate these in a systematic wy to the clinicla phenomenology of phatnom limbs. With the advent of non-invaive imaging techniques such as MEG (magnetoencephalogram) and functional MRI, topographical reoganization can also be demonstrated in humans, so that it is now possible to track perceptual changes and changes in cortical topography in individual patients. We suggest, therefore, that these patients provide a valuable opportunity not only or exploring neural plasticity in the adult human brain but also for understanding the relationship between the activity of sensory neurons and conscious experience. We conclude with a theory of phantom limbs, some striking demonstrations of phantoms induced in normal subjects and some remarks about the relevance of these phenomena to the question of how the brain constructs a 'body image'.},

In embodied cognition research, on the other hand, there is an increasing awareness that mind and body are inextricably intertwined and cannot be viewed in isolation. Findings in the field of cognitive neuroscience provide additional evidence cognition is tightly linked to perception and action. This paper aims to shed a light on the role of the body in situated learning activity by integrating the different perspectives of situated learning and embodied cognition research. The paper suggests that, like individual human conceptualization and thought, situated learning is in fact deeply rooted in bodily activity. In social interactions the body provides individuals with a similar perspective on the world, it functions as a means of signalling to others what cannot (yet) be expressed verbally, and it serves as a resonance mechanism in the understanding of others.},

  Abstract                 = {Mirror neurons are a particular type of neurons that discharge when an individual performs an action, as well as when he/she observes a similar action done by another individual. Mirror neurons have been described originally in the premotor cortex (area F5) of the mon- key. Subsequent studies have shown that they are present also in the monkey inferior parietal lobule (Rizzolatti et al. 2001).

In the human brain, evidence for mirror neurons is indirect, but, although there is no single-neuron study showing the existence of mirror neurons, functional imaging studies revealed activation of the likely homologue of monkey area F5 (area 44 and the adjacent ventral area 6) during action observation (see Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004). Furthermore, magnetoencephalography (Hari et al. 1998) and EEG (Cochin et al. 1999) have shown activation of motor cortex during observation of finger movements. Very recently, alpha rhythm desynchronization in functionally delimited language and hand motor areas was demonstrated during execution and observation of finger movements in a patient with implanted subdural electrodes (Tremblay et al. 2004).

What is the functional role of the mirror neurons? Various hypotheses have advanced: action understanding, imitation, intention understanding, and empathy (see Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; Gallese et al. 2004). In addition, it has been suggested that mirror-neuron system is the basic neural mechanism from which language developed (Rizzolatti and Arbib 1998).
It is my opinion that the question of which is the function of the mirror neurons or of the mirror-neuron system is ill posed. Mirror neurons do not have a specific functional role. The properties of mirror neurons indicate that primate brain is endowed with a mechanism mapping the pictorial description of actions, carried out in the higher order visual areas onto their motor counterpart. This matching mechanism may underlie a vari- ety of functions, depending on what aspect of the observed action is coded, the species considered, the circuit in which mirror neurons are included, and the connectivity of the mirror-neuron system with other systems.

Let us examine first action understanding, the original hypothesis that has been proposed for explaining the functional role of the mirror system (Gallese et al. 1996; Rizzolatti et al. 1996). It might sound bizarre that in order to recognize an action, one should activate the motor system. As a matter of fact, this is not so strange. A mere visual perception, without involvement of the motor system would only provide a description of the visible aspects of the movements of the agent. It would not give, however, information on the intrinsic compo- nents of the observed action, on what means doing it, and of the links of the observed actions with other actions related to it. To put the observed action into a motor semantic network is simply a necessity, if one has to understanding what the observed action is really about.},

These neurons (mirror neurons) appear to represent a system that matches observed events to similar, internally generated actions, and in this way forms a link between the observer and the actor. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and positron emission tomography (PET) experiments suggest that a mirror system for gesture recognition also exists in humans and includes Broca's area. We propose here that such an observation/execution matching system provides a necessary bridge from`doing' to`communicating',as the link between actor and observer becomes a link between the sender and the receiver of each message.},

A major question in language acquisition in the past few decades has been the extent to which infants use statistical learning mechanisms to acquire their native language. There have been many demonstrations showing infants' ability to extract structures in linguistic input, such as the transitional probability between adjacent elements. This paper reviews current research on how statistical learning contributes to language acquisition. Current research is extending the initial findings of infants' sensitivity to basic statistical information in many different directions, including investigating how infants represent regularities, learn about different levels of language, and integrate information across situations. These current directions emphasize studying statistical language learning in context: within language, within the infant learner, and within the environment as a whole},

In Exps II, III, and IV, internal structure was found to affect the perceptual encoding of physically identical pairs of stimuli, facilitating responses to physically identical good members and hindering responses to identical poor members of a category. Exps V and VI showed that the category name did not generate a physical code (e.g., lines or angles), but rather affected perception of the stimuli at the level of meaning. Exps VII and VIII showed that while the representation of the category name which affected perception contained a depth meaning common to words and pictures which enabled Ss to prepare for either stimulus form within 700 msec, selective reduction of the interval between prime and stimulus below 700 msec revealed differentiation of the coding of meaning in preparation for actual perception. Exp IX suggested that good examples of semantic categories are not physiologically determined, as the effects of the internal structure of semantic categories on priming (unlike the effects for color categories) could be eliminated by long practice.},

Using these structures, a planning algorithm integrates syntactic, semantic, and contextual constraints to generate natural and unambiguous descriptions of objects in novel scenes. The system generates syntactically well-formed compound adjective noun phrases, as well as relative spatial clauses. The acquired linguistic structures generalize from training data, enabling the production of novel word sequences which were never observed during training. The output of the generation system is synthesized using word-based concatenative synthesis drawing from the original training speech corpus. In evaluations of semantic comprehension by human judges, the performance of automatically generated spoken descriptions was comparable to human generated descriptions.

In other words, judgments of quantity in terms of units of measure or in terms of number always presuppose, explicitly or implicitly, preliminary judgments of grading. The term four means something only when it is known to refer to a number which is "less than" certain others, say five, six, seven, arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses, and "more than" certain others, say one, two, three,arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses. Similarly, a foot as a unit of linear measure has no meaning whatever unless it is known to be more than some other stretch, say an inch, and less than a third stretch, say a yard.},

  Abstract                 = {It is thought that meaning may be grounded in early childhood language learning via the physical and social interaction of the infant with those around him or her, and that the capacity to use words, phrases and their meaning are acquired through shared referential `inference' in pragmatic interactions. In order to create appropriate conditions for language learning by a humanoid robot, it would therefore be necessary to expose the robot to similar physical and social contexts. However in the early stages of language learning it is estimated that a 2-year-old child can be exposed to as many as 7,000 utterances per day in varied contextual situations. In this paper we report on the issues behind and the design of our currently ongoing and forthcoming experiments aimed to allow a robot to carry out language learning in a manner analogous to that in early child development and which effectively `short cuts' holophrase learning. Two approaches are used: (1) simulated babbling through mechanisms which will yield basic word or holophrase structures and (2) a scenario for interaction between a human and the humanoid robot where shared `intentional' referencing and the associations between physical, visual and speech modalities can be experienced by the robot. The output of these experiments, combined to yield word or holophrase structures grounded in the robot's own actions and modalities, would provide scaffolding for further proto- grammatical usage-based learning. This requires interaction with the physical and social environment involving human feedback to bootstrap developing linguistic competencies. These structures would then form the basis for further studies on language acquisition, including the emergence of negation and more complex grammar.},

Speakers with partners tended to use more egocentric perspectives than solo speakers. Pairs varied idiosyncratically in the perspective-setting strategies they picked, but all engaged in the same collaborative process: talking until both were sure they had understood each other. When conversational roles switched, the new speakers allocated spatial perspectives with remarkable precision, taking their partners' perspectives just as often as the partner had taken theirs. Speakers were more explicit about whose perspective they were taking when they held the floor for only one description than when they gave many descriptions in a row.},

  Abstract                 = {It is commonly argued that the rules of language, as distinct from its semantic features, are the characteristics which most clearly distinguish language from the communication systems of other species. A number of linguists (e.g., Chomsky 1972, 1980; Pinker 1994) have suggested that the universal features of grammar (UG) are unique human adaptations showing no evolutionary continuities with any other species. However, recent summaries of the substantive features of UG are quite remarkable in the very general nature of the features proposed. While the syntax of any given language can be quite complex, the specific rules vary so much between languages that the truly universal (i.e. innate) aspects of grammar are not complex at all. In fact, these features most closely resemble a set of general descriptions of our richly complex semantic cognition, and not a list of specific rules. General principles of the evolutionary process suggest that syntax is more properly understood as an emergent characteristic of the explosion of semantic complexity that occurred during hominid evolution. It is argued that grammatical rules used in given languages are likely to be simply conventionalized, invented features of language, and not the result of an innate, grammar- specific module. The grammatical and syntactic regularities that are found across languages occur simply because all languages attempt to communicate the same sorts of semantic information.},

  Abstract                 = {For robots to interact with each other and humans in a human environment, it is important for them to be able to use language meaningfully in practical applications. Grounding connects words and sentences with their meanings and is a necessary foundation for the meaningful usage of language. Combining simple concepts provides a way to label other simple concepts. The process of forming a simple concept from a combination of concepts is termed generative grounding in this thesis.

To understand how language may be used meaningfully in practical applications, the nature of language and the concepts on which language is built must be understood. Concepts of space and time are among those that are directly experienced and directly grounded. In particular, space is used to form other concepts with spatial metaphors used to describe mood, energy, emotion, personal attributes, and time.

This thesis addresses the question of how robots can form spatial languages. The literature review in Chapters 2 and 3 covers the diverse fields that this thesis builds on, from linguistics, computer science, psychology, neurology, and robotics. The literature review explores the language features that need to be addressed if language evolution and acquisition are to be understood, and the features of space and spatial language that make the domain appropriate for investigating the grounding and generative grounding of concepts.

The studies presented investigated grounding spatial language in mobile robots that had constructed maps to represent their world. The pilot studies investigated the underlying spatial representations and methods to produce and comprehend language. The experience map, a representation similar to a cognitive map of the world, provided the most appropriate representation for forming a spatial language.

A key question is what impact interactions between agents have on the languages. For the two major studies described in this thesis, agents interacted through language games and the experience map provided the base representation for concepts formation. A new way to associate concept elements and words was developed: the distributed lexicon table. Each study had three sections: an investigation into the experimental design of the language games in a simulation world based on a grid, the implementation of the language games in simulated robots, and the implementation of language games in the richer and less predictable real world.
The first study investigated spatial concept formation through collective experience and agent interactions as they explored their environment and played `where are we' games. Games were played when the agents were within hearing distance, with the shared attention defined by being near each other. After playing many language games, the agents successfully formed a toponymic language that labelled all visited locations.

The second study addressed the question of whether robots can form concepts for spatial relationships. Agents played `where is there' language games in addition to `where are we' language games. In `where is there' games, they referred to locations other than the current location. Shared attention was being near each other and the same perspective was achieved when an orientation location was named. A third target location was specified by name, direction, and distance. Agents formed a comprehensive spatial language of directions and distances that were combined to specify other locations in their world.

In summary, a computational language model for mobile robots was successfully developed, in which the robots formed spatial concepts that were associated with words through interactions with other agents. The features that made spatial concept formation easy included an appropriate concept representation, the distributed lexicon table with methods to produce and comprehend words, and simple interactions from which the language emerged. With the addition of generative interactions, the agents extended languages in which known locations were labelled to languages in which external locations were labelled. The result was robots that formed nouns (place names) and simple prepositions (direction and distance terms).
The major conclusions of this thesis are that generative grounding for spatial concepts is possible and that representations, methods, and social interactions influence the languages that form. The meaningful usage of language in practical applications therefore requires appropriate representations, interactions, and methods for grounding. This thesis has shown that rather than the directly perceivable world, it is interactions building on innate abilities that influence the final structure of spatial languages.},

(2) A language learning system based on a neural network architecture that has been designed and implemented with the ability to evolve generalizable languages which can be learned by naive learners. A study using visual scenes and internal maps streamed from the simulated world of the robots to evolve languages is presented. This study investigated the structure of the evolved languages showing that with these inputs, expressive languages can effectively categorize the world.

We can, however, study systems that support language and we can also develop models that explore the plausibility of different hypotheses about how language emerged. More recently, evolutionary linguists have begun to conduct language evolution experiments in the laboratory, where the emergence of new languages used by human participants can be observed directly. This enables researchers to study both the cognitive capacities necessary for language and the ways in which languages themselves emerge. One theme that runs through this work is how individual-level behaviours result in population-level linguistic phenomena. A central challenge for the future will be to explore how different forms of information transmission affect this process.},

The semantics of these verbs is specified with event-logic expressions that describe changes in the state of force-dynamic relations between the participants of the event. An efficient finite representation is introduced for the infinite sets of intervals that occur when describing liquid and semi-liquid events. Additionally, an efficient procedure using this representation is presented for inferring occurrences of compound events, de- scribed with event-logic expressions, from occurrences of primitive events. Using force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of events allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on motion profile.},

This algorithm offers one precise interpretation of the intuitive notions of cross-situational learning and the principle of contrast applied between words in an utterance. It robustly learns a homonymous lexicon despite noisy multi-word input, in the presence of referential uncertainty, with no prior knowledge that is specific to the language being learned. Computational simulations demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm and illustrate how algorithms based on cross-situational learning and the principle of contrast might be able to solve lexical-acquisition problems of the size faced by children, under weak, worst-case assumptions about the type and quantity of data available.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions in a multimodal setting is presented. The algorithm is based on empirical studies of how humans refer to objects in a shared workspace. The main ingredients of the algorithm are the following. First, the addition of deictic pointing gestures, where the decision to point is determined by two factors: the effort of pointing (measured in terms of the distance to and size of the target object) as well as the effort required for a full linguistic description (measured in terms of number of required properties and relations). Second, the algorithm explicitly keeps track of the current focus of attention, in such a way that objects which are closely related to the object which was most recently referred to are more prominent than objects which are farther away. To decide which object are `closely related' we make use of the concept of perceptual grouping. Finally, each object in the domain is assigned a three-dimensional salience weight indicating whether it is linguistically and/or inherently salient and whether it is part of the current focus of attention. The resulting algorithm is capable of generating a variety of referring expressions, where the kind of NP is co-determined by the accessibility of the target object (in terms of salience), the presence or absence of a relatum as well as the possible inclusion of a pointing gesture.},

These constraints are thought to work by enabling learners to resolve the ambiguity inherent in any labeled scene to determine the speaker's intended referent at that moment. The present study shows that 12- and 14-month-old infants can resolve the uncertainty problem in another way, not by unambiguously deciding the referent in a single word-scene pairing, but by rapidly evaluating the statistical evidence across many individually ambiguous words and scenes.},

  Abstract                 = {All languages of the world have a way to talk about space and spatial relations of objects. Cross-culturally, immense variation in how people conceptualize space for language has been attested. Different spatial conceptualization strategies such as proximal, projective and absolute have been identified to underlie peoples conception of spatial reality. This paper argues that spatial conceptualization strategies are negotiated in a cultural process of linguistic selection. Conceptualization strategies originate in the cognitive capabilities of agents. The ecological conditions and the structure of the environment influence the conceptualization strategy agents invent and which corresponding system of lexicon and ontology of spatial relations is selected for. The validity of these claims is explored using populations of humanoid robots.},

Slow Feature Analysis, an algorithm developed by theoretical biologists for extracting slowly changing signals from signals varying on a fast time scale, is applied to the problem of recognizing the posture of biped humanoid robots over time and successively on the recognition of the change of posture. Both the recognition of basic static postures, like lying and standing, of peer robots via visual sensory information and the recognition of the same postures via internal proprioceptive sensors are considered. Given promising results in this domain we extend the application of the method onto the dynamic domain of detecting the change of posture, specifically we show the utility of the algorithm for detecting when a robot falls.},

For this, we endow the agents with cognitive mechanisms and structures that are instantiations of specific ideas in cognitive linguistics (namely image schema theory) about how humans relate motor and visual space. We show that the agents are indeed able to perform well in the task and thus the experiment offers a concrete operationalization of these theories and increases their explanatory power.},

In order to provide embodied artificial systems with rich semantics reminiscent of human language complexity, agents need ways of both conceptualizing complex compositional semantic structure and actively reconstructing semantic structure, due to uncertainty and ambiguity in transmission. Furthermore, the systems must be open-ended and adaptive and allow agents to adjust their semantic inventories in order to reach their goals. This paper presents recent progress in modeling open-ended, grounded semantics through a unified software system that addresses these problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Flexible general purpose robots need to tailor their visual processing
to their task, on the fly. We propose a new approach to this within
a planning framework, where the goal is to plan a sequence of visual
operators to apply to the regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene.
We pose the visual processing problem as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). This requires probabilistic models of operator
effects to quantitatively capture the unreliability of the processing
actions, and thus reason precisely about trade-offs between plan
execution time and plan reliability. Since planning in practical
sized POMDPs is intractable we show how to ameliorate this intractability
somewhat for our domain by defining a hierarchical POMDP. We compare
the hierarchical POMDP approach with a Continual Planning (CP) approach.
On a real robot visual domain, we show empirically that all the planning
methods outperform naive application of all visual operators. The
key result is that the POMDP methods produce more robust plans than
either naive visual processing or the CP approach. In summary, we
believe that visual processing problems represent a challenging and
worthwhile domain for planning techniques, and that our hierarchical
POMDP based approach to them opens up a promising new line of research.},

  Abstract                 = { The recruitment theory of language origins argues that language users recruit and try out different strategies for solving the task of communication and retain those that maximise communicative success and cognitive economy. Each strategy requires specific cognitive neural mechanisms, which in themselves serve a wide range of purposes and therefore may have evolved or could be learned independently of language. The application of a strategy has an impact on the properties of the emergent language and this fixates the use of the strategy in the population. Although neurological evidence can be used to show that certain cognitive neural mechanisms are common to linguistic and non-linguistic tasks, this only shows that recruitment has happened, not why. To show the latter, we need models demonstrating that the recruitment of a particular strategy and hence the mechanisms to carry out this strategy lead to a better communication system. This paper gives concrete examples how such models can be built and shows the kinds of results that can be expected from them.},

  Abstract                 = {In the 1980s, a lot of ink was spent on the question of symbol grounding, largely triggered by Searle's Chinese room theory (Searle 1980). Searle's article had the advan- tage of stirring up discussion about when and how symbols could be about things in the world, whether intelligence involves representations or not, what embodiment means, and under what conditions cognition is embodied. But almost 25 years of philosophical discussion have shed little light on the issue, partly because the discussion has been mixed up with emotional arguments whether artificial intelligence (AI) is possible or not. However, today I believe that sufficient progress has been made in cognitive science and AI so that we can say that the symbol grounding problem has been solved. This chapter briefly discusses the issues of symbols, meanings, and embodiment (the main themes of the workshop), why I claim the symbol grounding problem has been solved, and what we should do next.},

AI has a long tradition of work in the representation of knowledge, most of it within the logical tradition. This tradition assumes that an autonomous agent is able to derive formal descriptions of the world which can then be the basis of logical inference and natural language understanding or production. This paper outlines some difficulties with this logical stance and reports alternative research on the development of an `embodied cognitive semantics' that is grounded in the world through a robot's sensori-motor system and is evolutionary in the sense that the conceptual frameworks underlying language are assumed to be adapted by agents in the course of dialogs and thus undergo constant change.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been a flurry of recent theoretical models trying to explain how and why human languages may have evolved grammatical structures (Hashimoto and Ikegami (1996), Nowak and Krakauer (1999)), and there has been a growing series of computer simulations and robotic experiments applying such models to evolve grounded communication systems in artificial agents (Cangelosi and Parisi (2001), Briscoe(2002), Steels(2003)). The problem of the origins of grammar is obviously a key question in research on the origins and evolution of languages, and it is only when we have clear theoretical models that we can hope to reconstruct the ontogenetic and phylogenetic pathways towards grammatical language.
Most research reported so far views the problem of verbal communication as a coding problem where a meaning M is coded by the speaker into an utterance u and then u is decoded by the hearer to reconstruct the same meaning M. Both processes are a function of the lexicon and grammar, further called the language inventory, of the speaker Is and hearer Ih, so that code(M,Is) = u and decode(u,Ih) = M.
It is common to argue that syntax arises to make both the size of the inventory and the length of the utterance for a given meaning more optimal (Nowak and Krakauer,1999). Language inventory can be minimised by using a compositional as opposed to a holistic coding. Utterance length can be minimised by coding certain aspects of meaning using syntactic means such as word order or hierarchy. A smaller inventory makes it easier to learn the language and it has therefore been argued that the learning bottleneck (i.e. the fact that language learners are only exposed to a limited number of sentences) encourages agents to choose a compositional as opposed to holistic coding (Smith, et.al., 2003). Although it cannot be denied that syntax has this kind of optimising effect, this paper proposes a different explanation for the role and therefore the emergence of grammar. Specifically, I will argue that the first primary function of grammar (but not the only one) is to optimise semantic interpretation. I will also argue that 'true' grammar only arises when there is an intermediary layer of linguistic categories and constructions as opposed to syntactic structure only.
The paper first defines formally the problem of semantic interpretation and characterises its computational complexity. It then reflects on the nature of grammar and argues that grammar only arises when there is an extra intermediary layer of syntactic and semantic categories that mediates between form and meaning. The paper then explores a peer-to-peer negotiation approach to the origins of grammar, in which grammatical categories and constraints on the use of these categories are progressively built and coordinated by the agents, triggered by the need to optimise semantic interpretation.},

Pet robots are currently entering the consumer market, and humanoid robots will soon follow. The ultimate success of such products will depend on our ability to resolve a key question: how we can design flexible, grounded dialogue systems for autonomous robots that permit open-ended dialogue with unprepared owners? This task is extraordinarily difficult and poses challenges for both integration and grounding. Here, I propose a unifying idea that meets both challenges: language games. A language game is a sequence of verbal interactions between two agents situated in a specific environment. Language games both integrate the various activities required for dialogue and ground unknown words or phrases in a specific context, which helps constrain possible meanings.

Over the past five years, I have been working with a team to develop and test language games on pro- gressively more sophisticated systems, from rela- tively simple camera-based systems to humanoid robots. The results of our work show that language games are a useful way to both understand and design human--robot interaction.},

In this article, I first review some of the existing proposals. I discuss the idea of inference structures such as heuristic classification (Clancey 1985), the distinction between deep and surface knowledge (Steels 1984), the notion of problem-solving methods and domain knowledge filling roles required by the methods (McDermott 1988), and the idea of generic tasks and task-specific architectures (Chandrasekaran 1983). These various proposals are obviously related to each other, which makes it desirable to construct a synthesis that combines their strengths. Such a synthesis is pre- sented here in the form of a componential framework. The framework stresses modularity and consideration of the pragmatic constraints of the domain.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the central themes in autonomous robot research concerns the question how visual images of body movements by others can be interpreted and related to one's own body movements and to language describing these body movements. The discovery of mirror neurons has shown that there are brain circuits which become active both in the perception and the re-enactment of bodily gestures, although it is so far unclear how these circuits can form, i.e. how neurons become mirror neurons. We report here further progress with our robot experiments in which a group of autonomous robots play language games in order to coordinate their visual, motor and cognitive body image. We have shown that the right kind of semiotic dynamics can lead to the self-organisation of a successful communication system with which robots can ask each other to perform certain actions. The main contribution of this paper is to show that if the robot has the capacity to `imagine' the behavior of his own body through self-simulation, he is better able to guess what action corresponds to a visual image produced by another robot and thus guess the meaning of an unknown word. This leads to a significant speed-up in the way individual agents are able to coordinate visual categories, motor behaviors and language.},

A language strategy packages all the procedures that are necessary for playing a language game. We present a specific example of a language strategy for playing an Action Game in which one robot asks another robot to take on a body posture (such as stand or sit), and show how it effectively allows a population of agents to self-organise a perceptually grounded ontology and a lexicon from scratch, without any human intervention. Next, we show how a new language strategy can arise by exaptation from an existing one, concretely, how the body posture strategy can be exapted to a strategy for playing language games about the spatial position of objects (as in ``the bottle stands on the table'').},

  Abstract                 = {Humans maintain a body image of themselves, which plays a central role in controlling bodily movement, planning action, recognising and naming actions performed by others, and requesting or executing commands. This paper explores through experiments with autonomous humanoid robots how such a body image could form. Robots play a situated embodied language game called the Action Game in which they ask each other to perform bodily actions. They start without any prior inventory of names, without categories for visually recognising body movements of others, and without knowing the relation between visual images of motor behaviors carried out by others and their own motor behaviors. Through diagnostic and repair strategies carried out within the context of action games, they progressively self-organise an effective lexicon as well as bi-directional mappings between the visual and the motor domain. The agents thus establish and continuously adapt networks linking perception, body representation, action, and language.},

How can human language users nevertheless have such a high rate of communicative success? And how do they deal with the incomplete sentences, false starts, errors and noise that is common in normal discourse? Fluidity, ungrammaticality and error are key problems for formal descriptions of language and for computational implementations of language processing because these seem to be necessarily rigid and mechanical. This chapter discusses how these issues are approached within the framework of Fluid Construction Grammar. Fluidity is not achieved by a single mechanism but through a combination of intelligent grammar design and flexible processing principles.},

To maintain coherence in the overall system, different language elements (sounds, words, grammatical constructions) compete with each other for global acceptance. This paper examines what happens when a language system uses systematic structure, in the sense that certain meaning-form conventions are themselves parts of larger units. We argue that in this case multi-level selection occurs: at the level of elements (e.g. tense affixes) and at the level of larger units in which these elements are used (e.g. phrases). Achieving and maintaining linguistic coherence in the population under these conditions is non-trivial. This paper shows that it is nevertheless possible when agents take multiple levels into account both for processing meaning-form associations and for consolidating the language inventory after each interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {According to the functional approach to language evolution (inspired by cognitive linguistics and construction grammar), grammar arises to deal with issues in communication among autonomous agents, particularly maximisation of communicative success and expressive power and minimisation of cognitive effort. Experiments in the emergence of grammar should hence start from a simulation of communicative exchanges between embodied agents, and then show how a particular issue that arises can be solved or partially solved by introducing more grammar. This paper shows a case study of this approach, focusing on the issue of search during parsing. Multiple hypotheses arise in parsing when the same syntactic pattern can be used for multiple purposes or when one syntactic pattern partly overlaps with another one. It is well known that syntactic ambiguity rapidly leads to combinatorial explosions and hence an increase in memory use and processing power, possibly to a point where the sentence can no longer be handled. Additional grammar, such as syntactic or semantic subcategorisation or word order and agreement constraints can help to dampen search because it provides information to the hearer which hypotheses are the most likely. The paper shows an operational experiment where avoiding search is used as the driver for the introduction and negotiation of syntax. The experiment is also a demonstration of how Fluid Construction Grammar is well suited for experiments in language evolution.},

The latter requires a number of changes to the models and practices of cognitive linguistics: it must refocus on its linguistic heritage, adopt a more scientific outlook, gain a higher degree of methodological awareness and restrict its models to linguistic constructs and hypotheses that can be operationalized and falsified.},

This article introduces a second-order neural network with parametric biases (sNNPB) that learns compositional structures based on sensorimotor time series data. The data was pro- duced by a simulated robot that executed distinct object interactions (move-to and orient-toward). We show that various sNNPB setups can learn to compositionally imitate object interactions beyond the interactions that were specifically trained, which was not possible with previous neural network (NN) architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We also show that these imitation capabilities are accomplished by developing a self- organized, geometrically arranged compositional concept structure in the PB values and task-oriented, Braitenberg-like sensory encodings in hidden sensory layers. Because second-order connections were necessary to accomplish the task, we hypothesize that such connections may be essential to drive the learning of both sensorimotor-grounded compositional structures and Braitenberg-like, behavior-oriented ``pro-presentations.'' From a cognitive perspective, we show how sensorimotor time series of interactions may be processed to generate the signals necessary to develop semantically compositional structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Maintaining accurate world knowledge in a complex and changing environment is a perennial problem for robots and other artificial intelligence systems. Our architecture for addressing this problem, called Horde, consists of a large number of independent reinforcement learning sub-agents, or demons. Each demon is responsible for answering a sin- gle predictive or goal-oriented question about the world, thereby contributing in a factored, modular way to the sys- tem's overall knowledge. The questions are in the form of a value function, but each demon has its own policy, re- ward function, termination function, and terminal-reward function unrelated to those of the base problem. Learning proceeds in parallel by all demons simultaneously so as to extract the maximal training information from whatever ac- tions are taken by the system as a whole. Gradient-based temporal-difference learning methods are used to learn ef- ficiently and reliably with function approximation in this off-policy setting. Horde runs in constant time and memory per time step, and is thus suitable for learning online in real- time applications such as robotics. We present results using Horde on a multi-sensored mobile robot to successfully learn goal-oriented behaviors and long-term predictions from off- policy experience. Horde is a significant incremental step towards a real-time architecture for efficient learning of gen- eral knowledge from unsupervised sensorimotor interaction.},

To these it adds the basic ideational and affective categories attributed to cognitive agents, such as attention and perspective, volition and intention, and expectation and affect. It addresses the semantic structure of morphological and lexical forms, as well as of syntactic patterns. And it addresses the interrelationships of conceptual structures, such as those in metaphoric mapping, those within a semantic frame, those between text and context, and those in the grouping of conceptual categories into large structuring systems.

We show that gaze, route, and survey perspectives use language differently and argue that they correspond to prototypic relative, intrinsic, and extrinsic frames of reference, respectively. We speculate that the correlation of viewpoint, referent, and terms of referent in the three perspectives occurs because each reflects a natural way of interacting with an environment.},

The framework, which is based on English, allows for identifying and accounting for the relationship between spatial and temporal concepts systematically. Furthermore, it highlights the distinction between conceptually similar (spatial and temporal) structures reflected in language on the one hand, and metaphorical transfer of clearly spatially based concepts on the other.},

  Abstract                 = {This report presents a summary and discussion of findings in the literature with respect to the linguistic repertory (syntactic variability), semantics, and application of spatial dimensional terms in English and German, such as left/links or above/oben. These terms are called dimensional because they describe the relation of two entities to each other on a specific spatial dimension. Their application depends on a wide range of situation- and discourse- related factors, such as the conceptualisation of underlying reference systems, the nature of the entities to be related, and the discourse task. Each of these issues will be dealt with separately in order to determine their specific impact on the interpretation and applicability of the spatial terms.
I will start with a detailed presentation of the range of variety in spatial language, with specific focus on dimensional terms, and then turn to the wide range of aspects coming into play in their application. Many important findings are not restricted to dimensional terms, but it is only with respect to dimensional terms that I aim towards completion and detail in presentation to the greatest possible extent.
A number of interesting insights on the variability, features, and applicability of English spatial terms is collected in the seminal work of Herskovits (1986). I will start from her insights and supplement these with more recent findings as well as (contrasting or equivalent) observations pertaining to the German language, relying on a number of sources. Most literature on spatial terms presents syntactic variability and semantic aspects of the various expressions along with various pragmatic factors influencing their application. My aim in the present work is to keep these issues apart as far as possible, in order to present, on the one hand, an overview of the linguistic repertory, and on the other, an account of the range of discourse-related and discourse-external factors coming into play in the application of this repertory. Although this is clearly a simplification in light of the fact that language is only meaningful in its application in discourse, I will start from Herskovits' assumption that there is a semantic core for every spatial expression. This assumption will be discussed and modified in the first section of the present work. The following sections then examine findings with regard to pragmatic factors, including considerations of underlying reference systems (starting from the systematics provided by Levinson 2003), and functional factors influencing applicability (such as those addressed in the work of Carlson, Coventry, Garrod, and related research).},

Spatial scenarios were presented that varied with respect to number, shape, and location of elements, and with respect to possible perspectives. The linguistic analysis reveals that speakers adhere to underlying principles similar to those known for non-spatial object reference. If objects only differ in spatial position, a reference system and spatial axis is chosen that is suitable for contrasting the target object from competing ones. The exact spatial location is usually not specified if there are no competing objects closeby.},

To reduce annotation effort while maintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to two non-classification tasks in natural language processing: semantic parsing and information extraction. We show that active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated examples required to achieve a given level of performance for these complex tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Provides a comprehensive usage-based theory of language acquisition. Drawing together a vast body of empirical research in cognitive science, linguistics, and developmental psychology, the author demonstrates that we don't need a self-contained "language instinct" to explain how children learn language. Their linguistic ability is interwoven with other cognitive abilities. Tomasello argues that the essence of language is its symbolic dimension, which rests on the uniquely human ability to comprehend intention. Grammar emerges as the speakers of a language create linguistic constructions out of recurring sequences of symbols; children pick up these patterns in the buzz of words they hear around them. All theories of language acquisition assume these fundamental skills of intention-reading and pattern-finding. Some formal linguistic theories posit a second set of acquisition process to connect with an innate universal grammar. But these extra processes, Tomasello argues, are completely unnecessary--important to save the theory but not to explain the phenomenon. This book offers a sound new vision, different from Chomskian generative grammar, for the study of language acquisition.


[review]
Child psychiatrists, pediatricians, and other child clinicians need to have a solid understanding of child language development. There are at least four important reasons that make this necessary. First, slowing, arrest, and deviation of language development are highly associated with, and com- plicate the course of, child psychopathology. Second, lan- guage competence plays a crucial role in emotional and mood regulation, evaluation, and therapy. Third, language deficits are the most frequent underpinning of the learning disorders, ubiquitous in our clinical populations. Fourth, clinicians should not confuse the rich linguistic and dialectal diversity of our clinical populations with abnormalities in child language development.

The challenge for the clinician becomes, then, how to get immersed in the captivating field of child language acquisi- tion without getting overwhelmed by its conceptual and empirical complexity. In the past 50 years and since the seminal works of Roger Brown, Jerome Bruner, and Catherine Snow, child language researchers (often known as developmental psycholinguists) have produced a remarkable body of knowledge. Linguists such as Chomsky and philosophers such as Grice have strongly influenced the science of child language. One of the major tenets of Chomskian linguistics (known as generative grammar) is that children's capacity to acquire language is "hardwired" with "universal grammar"-an innate language acquisition device (LAD), a language "instinct"-at its core. This view is in part supported by the assertion that the linguistic input that children receive is relatively dismal and of poor quality relative to the high quantity and quality of output that they manage to produce after age 2 and that only an advanced, innate capacity to decode and organize linguistic input can enable them to "get from here (prelinguistic infant) to there (linguistic child)."

In "Constructing a Language," Tomasello presents a contrasting theory of how the child acquires language: It is not a universal grammar that allows for language development. Rather, human cognition universals of communicative needs and vocal-auditory processing result in some language universals, such as nouns and verbs as expressions of reference and predication (p. 19). The author proposes that two sets of cognitive skills resulting from biological/phylogenetic adaptations are fundamental to the ontogenetic origins of language. These sets of inherited cognitive skills are intention-reading on the one hand and pattern-finding, on the other. Intention-reading skills encompass the prelinguistic infant's capacities to share attention to outside events with other persons, establishing joint attentional frames, to understand other people's communicative intentions, and to imitate the adult's communicative intentions (an intersubjective form of imitation that requires symbolic understanding and perspective-taking). Pattern-finding skills include the ability of infants as young as 7 months old to analyze concepts and percepts (most relevant here, auditory or speech percepts) and create concrete or abstract categories that contain analogous items.

Tomasello, a most prominent developmental scientist with research foci on child language acquisition and on social cognition and social learning in children and primates, succinctly and clearly introduces the major points of his theory and his views on the origins of language in the initial chapters. In subsequent chapters, he delves into the details by covering most language acquisition domains, namely, word (lexical) learning, syntax, and morphology and conversation, narrative, and extended discourse. Although one of the remaining domains (pragmatics) is at the core of his theory and permeates the text throughout, the relative paucity of passages explicitly devoted to discussing acquisition and production of speech sounds (phonology) is somewhat surprising, given that he postulates auditory pattern-finding as a biological skill fundamental for language acquisition. Similarly, while intention-reading (pragmatic) deficiencies are illustrated with examples from individuals with autism and semantic-pragmatic disorders, a parallel clinical illustration of (phonological) pattern-finding deficits is curiously absent. In this way, extensive work on deficits in phonological processing and awareness in language disorders, reading problems, and language-based learning disorders (e.g., dys- lexia) is not mentioned, although it is potentially supportive of Tomasello's theory.

According to the author, it is the social-cognitive dexterity and drive to read and understand the intentional and mental states of others that pave the path of language learning. The idea that language is primarily acquired as a reaction to the human world that surrounds the child squarely contrasts with Chomskian thought. Acknowledging this, Tomasello systematically refutes Chomsky's theory, including the claim that there is poverty of stimuli for language, by explaining how language is acquired from the first utterance to complex clauses. A child's earnest attempt to understand others while interacting socially and linguistically is central to the acquisition of language. It is while reading adults' intentions and jointly sharing attention that children collect and segment the necessary language components, recognize speech patterns, and conceptualize referents to later create new constructions of their own. Acquisition of the more complex grammatical items (such as binding principles of pronouns) is developmentally staggered, which demonstrates learning of these constructions rather than an always-present innate ability. The usage-based theory views grammar as a derivative of language, not a prerequisite. Using suitable referential situations, children form new constructions and are, in effect, able to "get from here to there" without a biological adaptation for universal grammar.

Recognizing that child language development is a process integrated with sociocognitive and attentional development has important implications for our field. If one takes to heart our initial tenet that child clinicians need to have a solid understanding of child language development, this book provides this understanding while broadening the clinical perspective considerably. Although this book does not directly address emotional/behavioral development, it suggests fertile ideas with potential application in the four important areas mentioned above. First, psychiatrically ill children's joint attention or pattern-finding skills may present either deficits associated with language deficit or strengths that may potentially mitigate language deficit. Second, linguistic, communicative, and cognitive processes (joint attentional frames, pattern-finding that enables concrete and abstract analogies, need to understand others' viewpoints, normative
symbolization) border with other processes involved in emotion/mood regulation, clinical evaluation, and therapy. Finally, the new normative dimensions proposed frame our understanding of child language learning, with implications for learning and language disabilities (third) and for work with linguistically diverse populations (fourth).
With a commendable emphasis on empirical research, Tomasello steers clear of unsupported ideas or philosophies and makes a strong case for his theory with applications and empirical references. A rich overview of language acquisition is put forth in an accessible manner, without excessive use of technical terms, and launches the reader into new directions in the psychological understanding of language acquisition, creating an approachable resource for those who live outside the world of linguistics. Above all, this book provides a fascinating illustration of a conceptual model that integrates many observational pieces into a coherent whole. Novel conceptual frameworks such as this are urgently needed in child psychiatry to advance the field by encouraging research to challenge prevailing views.},

  Abstract                 = {A language is composed of conventional symbols shaped by their social-communicative functions. Children acquire these symbols, both lexical and syntactic, in the context of culturally constituted event structures that make salient these functions. In the acquisition process children rely on cultural learning skills (i. e., imitative learning). These skills emanate from their ability to participate intersubjectively with adults in cultural activities (i.e., joint attention), which underlies their ability to understand the ways adults are using particular pieces of language. The development of communic- ative competence as a whole, including not only lexical and syntactic skills but also various pragmatic skills, depends largely on feedback about communicative efficacy that children receive from different interactants. This feedback is used by children to make further inferences about the conventional functional significance of particular linguistic expressions. This social-pragmatic view of language acquisition obviates the need for a priori, specifically linguistic, formal constraints on the language acquisition process.},

We argue for the importance of processes of shared intentionality in children's early cognitive development. We look briefly at four important social-cognitive skills and how they are transformed by shared intentionality. In each case, we look first at a kind of individualistic version of the skill -- as exemplified most clearly in the behavior of chimpanzees -- and then at a version based on shared intentionality -- as exemplified most clearly in the behavior of human 1- and 2-year-olds. We thus see the following transformations: gaze following into joint attention, social manipulation into cooperative communication, group activity into collaboration, and social learning into instructed learning. We conclude by highlighting the role that shared intentionality may play in integrating more biologically based and more culturally based theories of human development.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose that the crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species is the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions: shared intentionality. Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with oth- ers and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.},

We argue here that this is actually the second ontogenetic step in uniquely human social cognition. The first step is one year old children's understanding of persons as intentional agents, which enables skills of cultural learning and shared intentionality. This initial step is `the real thing' in the sense that it enables young children to participate in cultural activities using shared, perspectival symbols with a conventional/normative/reflective dimensionÐfor example, linguistic communication and pretend playÐthus inaugurating children's understanding of things mental. Understanding beliefs and participating in collective intentionality at four years of ageÐenabling the comprehension of such things as money and marriageÐresults from several years of engagement with other persons in perspective-shifting and reflective discourse containing propositional attitude constructions.},

Starting from actual case studies rather than theoretical assumptions, methodological issues concerning the usage-based approach are addressed, with specific reference to the use of corpus materials. The specific methodological identity of us- age-based linguistics is described in terms of data gathering strategies and the status of empirical data in linguistic research. From a delineation of corpus research in contrast with introspection, survey research, and experi- mentation, two criteria emerge as essential for a genuine corpus-oriented usage-based linguistics, viz. the use of quantitative techniques and the sys- tematic operationalization of research hypotheses. It is suggested that pay- ing closer attention to these methodological issues is a prerequisite for the further development of the usage-based approach in Cognitive Linguistics.},

Two studies asked respondents to describe the spatial relations between two objects on a table in photographed scenes; in some versions, a person sitting behind the objects was either looking at or reaching for one of the objects. The mere presence of another person in a position to act on the objects induced a good proportion of respondents to describe the spatial relations from that person's point of view (Experiment 1). When the query about the spatial relations was phrased in terms of action, more respondents took the other's perspective than their own (Experiment 2). The implication of action elicits spontaneous spatial perspective-taking, seemingly in the service of understanding the other's actions.},

  Abstract                 = { Although considerations of discourse coherence and cognitive processing suggest that communicators should adopt consistent perspectives when describing spatial scenes, in many cases they switch perspectives. Ongoing research examining cognitive costs indicates that these are small and exacted in establishing a mental model of a scene but not in retrieving information from a well-known scene. A perspective entails a point of view, a referent object, and terms of reference. These may change within a perspective, exacting cognitive costs, so that the costs of switching perspective may not be greater than the costs of maintaining the same perspective. Another project investigating perspective choice for self and other demonstrates effects of salience of referent object and ease of terms of reference. Perspective is mixed not just in verbal communications but also in pictorial ones, suggesting that at times,},

  Abstract                 = {Using a cognitive linguistics perspective, this book provides the most comprehensive theoretical analysis of the semantics of English prepositions available. All English prepositions originally coded spatial relations between two physical entities; while retaining their original meaning, prepositions have also developed a rich set of non-spatial meanings. In this innovative study, Tyler and Evans argue that all these meanings are systematically grounded in the nature of human spatio-physical experience. The original `spatial scenes' provide the foundation for the extension of meaning from the spatial to the more abstract. This analysis introduces a new methodology that distinguishes between a conventional meaning and an interpretation produced for understanding the preposition in context, as well as establishing which of several competing senses should be taken as the primary sense. Together, the methodology and framework are sufficiently articulated to generate testable predictions and allow the analysis to be applied to additional prepositions.},

  Abstract                 = {Case languages use an inflectional category system for marking event structure. The research in this thesis investigates how such a grammati- cal system can be developed as the consequence of distributed processes whereby language users continuously shape and reshape their language in locally situated communicative interactions. Since these processes are notoriously difficult to grasp in natural languages, this thesis offers ad- ditional evidence from computational simulations in which autonomous artificial agents self-organise a case-like grammar with similar properties as found in case languages such as German, Latin and Turkish.

This thesis hypothesises that language users gradually build their grammar in order to optimise their communicative success and expressiveness while at the same time reducing the cognitive effort needed for semantic interpretation. In the experiments, artificial agents engage in a series of `language games' in which the speaker has to describe a dynamic event to the hearer. The agents are equipped with diagnostics for autonomously detecting communicative problems, repair strategies for solving these problems, and alignment strategies for coordinating their linguistic inventories with each other. Through comparative simulations, this thesis aims at demonstrating which communicative and external pressures and which cognitive mechanisms are minimally required for the formation of a case grammar.

Two innovating experiments are reported. The first experiment offers the first multi-agent simulations ever that involve polysemous categories. The agents are capable of inventing grammatical markers for indicating event structure and of generalising these markers to semantic roles by performing analogical reasoning over events. Extension by analogy occurs as a side-effect of the need to optimise communicative success and is accompanied by careful abstraction, which yields an increased productivity of the categories. In the second experiment, the agents are capable of combining markers into larger argument structure constructions through pattern formation. The results show that languages become unsystematic if the linguistic inventory is unstructured and contains multiple levels of organisation. This thesis demonstrates that this problem of systematicity can be solved using multi-level selection.},

This paper presents arguments for approaching the anchoring problem using semiotic symbols. Semiotic symbols are defined by a triadic relation between forms, meanings and referents, thus having an implicit relation to the real world. Anchors are formed between these three elements rather than between [`]traditional' symbols and sensory images. This allows an optimization between the form (i.e. the [`]traditional' symbol) and the referent. A robotic experiment based on adaptive language games illustrates how the anchoring of semiotic symbols can be achieved in a bottom-up fashion. The paper concludes that applying semiotic symbols is a potentially valuable approach toward anchoring.},

The robots are autonomous in terms of computing and cognition, but they are otherwise far simpler than most, if not all animals. It is demonstrated that a lexicon nevertheless can be made to emerge even though there are strong limits on the size and stability of this lexicon.

It will be argued that symbolic structures can be used within the paradigm of embodied cognitive science by adopting an alternative definition of a symbol. In this alternative definition, the symbol may be viewed as a structural coupling between an agent's sensorimotor activations and its environment. A robotic experiment is presented in which mobile robots develop a symbolic structure from scratch by engaging in a series of language games. In this experiment it is shown that robots can develop a symbolic structure with which they can communicate the names of a few objects with a remarkable degree of success. It is further shown that, although the referents may be interpreted differently on different occasions, the objects are usually named with only one form.},

This is done by comparing three language game models that differ in the type of social interactions they use. The simulations show that the language games which use either joint attention or corrective feedback as a source of contextual input are better capable of bootstrapping a lexicon than the game without such directed interactions. The simulation of the latter game, however, does show that it is possible to develop a lexicon without using directed input when the lexicon is transmitted from generation to generation.

This paper reports two experiments that use a confederate-priming paradigm to examine whether interlocutors also align their spatial representations during dialogue. Experiment 1 showed a significant reference frame priming effect: Speakers tended to use the same reference frame to locate an object in a scene as the frame that they had just heard their interlocutor use. Experiment 2 demonstrated the same pattern even when the speaker's description and their partner's previous description involved different prepositions. Hence the effect cannot be explained in terms of lexical priming of a particular preposition. Our results are strong evidence that interlocutors in a dialogue align non-linguistic as well as linguistic representations.},

EE uses a population of physical robots that autonomously reproduce with one another while situated in their task environment. This constitutes a fully distributed evolutionary algorithm embodied in physical robots. Several issues identified by researchers in the evolu- tionary robotics community as problematic for the development of ER are alleviated by the use of a large number of robots being evaluated in parallel. Particularly, EE avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method and allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism. The more novel features of EE are that the evolutionary algorithm is entirely decentralized, which makes it inherently scalable to large numbers of robots, and that it uses many robots in a shared task environment, which makes it an interesting platform for future work in collective robotics and Artificial Life. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented the first example of Embodied Evolution by designing a fully decentralized, asynchronous evolutionary algorithm. Controllers evolved by EE outperform a hand-designed controller in a simple application. We introduce our approach and its motivations, detail our implementation and initial results, and discuss the advantages and limitations of EE.},

  Abstract                 = {How should biological behaviour be modelled? A relatively new approach is to investigate problems in neuroethology by building physical robot models of biological sensorimotor systems. The explication and justification of this approach are here placed within a framework for describing and comparing models in the behavioural and biological sciences. First, simulation models -- the representation of a hypothesis about a target system -- are distinguished from several other relationships also termed ``modelling'' in discussions of scientific explanation. Seven dimensions on which simulation models can differ are defined and distinctions between them discussed:
1. Relevance: whether the model tests and generates hypotheses applicable to biology.
2. Level: the elemental units of the model in the hierarchy from atoms to societies.
3. Generality: the range of biological systems the model can represent.
4. Abstraction: the complexity, relative to the target, or amount of detail included in the model.
5. Structural accuracy: how well the model represents the actual mechanisms underlying the behaviour. 6. Performance match: to what extent the model behaviour matches the target behaviour.
7. Medium: the physical basis by which the model is implemented.
No specific position in the space of models thus defined is the only correct one, but a good modelling methodology should be explicit about its position and the justification for that position. It is argued that in building robot models biological relevance is more effective than loose biological inspiration; multiple levels can be integrated; that generality cannot be assumed but might emerge from studying specific instances; abstraction is better done by simplification than idealisation; accuracy can be approached through iterations of complete systems; that the model should be able to match and predict target behaviour; and that a physical medium can have significant advantages. These arguments reflect the view that biological behaviour needs to be studied and modelled in context, that is, in terms of the real problems faced by real animals in real environments.},

In particular situations, the communicative correspondence between the reference to an intended space (production) and the interpretation of such an utterance (comprehension) is stronger in English than in German.

The problem that an agent cannot point to meaning but only to objects, represents one of the core aspects of the problem. Even with a straightforward representation of meaning, such as a set of boolean features, the hypothesis space scales exponential in the number of primitive features. Furthermore, data suggests that human learners grasp aspects of many novel words after only a few exposures. We propose a model that can handle the exponential increase in uncertainty and allows scaling towards very large meaning spaces. The key novelty is that word learning or bootstrapping should not be viewed as a mapping task, in which a set of forms is to be mapped onto a set of (predefined) concepts. Instead we view word learning as a process in which the representation of meaning gradually shapes itself, while being usable in interpretation and production almost instantly.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning the meanings of words requires coping with referential uncertainty -- a learner hearing a novel word cannot be sure which aspects or properties of the referred object or event comprise the meaning of the word. Data from developmental psychology suggests that human learners grasp the important aspects of many novel words after only a few exposures, a phenomenon known as fast mapping. Traditionally, word learning is viewed as a mapping task, in which the learner has to map a set of forms onto a set of pre-existing concepts. We criticize this approach and argue instead for a flexible nature of the coupling between form and meanings as a solution to the problem of referential uncertainty. We implemented and tested the model in populations of humanoid robots that play situated language games about objects in their shared environment. Results show that the model can handle an exponential increase in uncertainty and allows scaling towards very large meaning spaces, while retaining the ability to grasp an operational meaning almost instantly for a great number of words. Additionally, the model captures some aspects of the flexibility of form-meaning associations found in human languages. Meanings of words can shift between being very specific (names) and general (e.g. ``small''). We show that this specificity is biased not by the model itself but by the distribution of object properties in the world.},

  Abstract                 = {How does one create an intelligent machine? This problem has proven difficult. Over the past several decades, scientists have taken one of three approaches: In the first, which is knowledge-based, an intelligent machine in a laboratory is directly programmed to perform a given task. In a second, learning-based approach, a computer is "spoon-fed" human-edited sensory data while the machine is controlled by a task-specific learning program. Finally, by a "genetic search," robots have evolved through generations by the principle of survival of the fittest, mostly in a computer-simulated virtual world. Although notable, none of these is powerful enough to lead to machines having the complex, diverse, and highly integrated capabilities of an adult brain, such as vision, speech, and language. Nevertheless, these traditional approaches have served as the incubator for the birth and growth of a new direction for machine intelligence: autonomous mental development. As Kuhn wrote (1), "Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones."},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we describe two models for neural grounding of robotic language processing in actions. These models are inspired by concepts of the mirror neuron system in order to produce learning by imitation by combining high-level vision, language and motor command inputs. The models learn to perform and recognise three behaviours, `go', `pick' and `lift'. The first single-layer model uses an adapted Helmholtz machine wake-sleep algorithm to act like a Kohonen self-organising network that receives all inputs into a single layer. In contrast, the second, hierarchical model has two layers. In the lower level hidden layer the Helmholtz machine wake-sleep algorithm is used to learn the relationship between action and vision, while the upper layer uses the Kohonen self-organising approach to combine the output of the lower hidden layer and the language input.

On the hidden layer of the single-layer model, the action words are represented on non-overlapping regions and any neuron in each region accounts for a corresponding sensory-motor binding. In the hierarchical model rather separate sensory- and motor representations on the lower level are bound to corresponding sensory-motor pairings via the top level that organises according to the language input.},

  Abstract                 = {Relevance theory may be seen as an attempt to work out in detail one of Grice's central claims: that an essential feature of most human communication, both verbal and non-verbal, is the expression and recognition of intentions (Grice 1989: Essays 1-7, 14, 18; Retrospective Epilogue). In developing this claim, Grice laid the foundations for an inferential model of communication, an alternative to the classical code model. According to the code model, a communicator encodes her intended message into a signal, which is decoded by the audience using an identical copy of the code. 
According to the inferential model, a communicator provides evidence of her intention to convey a certain meaning, which is inferred by the audience on the basis of the evidence provided. An utterance is, of course, a linguistically coded piece of evidence, so that verbal comprehension involves an element of decoding. However, the linguistic meaning recovered by decoding is just one of the inputs to a non-demonstrative inference process which yields an interpretation of the speaker's meaning},

Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in normal English dialog. It uses semantic information and context to understand discourse and to disambiguate sentences. It combines a complete syntactic analysis of each sentence with a "heuristic understander" which uses different kinds of information about a sentence, other parts of the discourse, and general information about the world in deciding what the sentence means. It is based on the belief that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can "understand" the subject it is discussing. The program is given a detailed model of the knowledge needed by a simple robot having only a hand and an eye. We can give it instructions to manipulate toy objects, interrogate it about the scene, and give it information it will use in deduction. In addition to knowing the properties of toy objects, the program has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carry them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, and asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through use of context and physical knowledge.},

(2) object learning -- how to recognize and categorize visual objects. We argue that those two problems can be fundamentally simplified by considering them in a general system and incorporating the spatio-temporal and cross-modal constraints of multimodal data. The system collects egocentric data including image sequences as well as speech while users perform natural tasks. It is able to automatically infer the meanings of object names from vision, and categorize objects based on teaching signals potentially encoded in speech.

A concept which plays an essential role in the treatment of fuzzy quantifiers is that of the cardinality of a fuzzy set. Through the use of this concept, the meaning of a proposition containing one or more fuzzy quantifiers may be represented as a system of elastic constraints whose domain is a collection of fuzzy relations in a relational database. This representation, then, provides a basis for inference from premises which contain fuzzy quantifiers. For example, from the propositions ``Most U's are A's'' and ``Most A's are
B's,'' it follows that ``Most U's are B's,'' where most is the fuzzy product of the fuzzy proportion most with itself.

The computational approach to fuzzy quantifiers which is described in this paper may be viewed as a derivative of fuzzy logic and test-score semantics. In this semantics; the meaning of a semantic entity is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by the entity in question.},

Such robots need skills that allow them to interact with the world and the humans living and working therein. In this paper we investigate the question of spatial understanding of human-made environments. The functionalities of our system comprise perception of the world, natural language, learning, and reasoning. For this purpose we integrate state-of-the-art components from different disciplines in AI, robotics and cognitive systems into a mobile robot system. The work focuses on the description of the principles we used for the integration, including cross-modal integration, ontology-based mediation, and multiple levels of abstraction of perception. Finally, we present experiments with the integrated ``CoSy Explorer''1 system and list some of the major lessons that were learned from its design, implementation, and evaluation.},

A key idea is to introduce non-standard CCG combinators that relax certain parts of the grammar---for example allowing flexible word order, or insertion of lexical items--- with learned costs. We also present a new, online algorithm for inducing a weighted CCG. Results for the approach on ATIS data show 86% F-measure in recovering fully correct semantic analyses and 95.9% F-measure by a partial-match criterion, a more than 5% improvement over the 90.3% partial-match figure reported by He and Young (2006).},

  Abstract                 = {The study of the origin and early evolution of birds has never produced as much excitement and public attention as in the past decade. Well preserved and abundant new fossils of birds and dinosaurs have provided unprecedented new evidence on the dinosaurian origin of birds, the arboreal origin of avian flight, and the origin of feathers prior to flapping flight. The Mesozoic avian assemblage mainly comprises two major lineages: the prevalent extinct group Enantiornithes, and the Ornithurae, which gave rise to all modern birds, as well as several more basal taxa. Cretaceous birds radiated into various paleoecological niches that included fish- and seed-eating. Significant size and morphological differences and variation in flight capabilities, ranging from gliding to powerful flight among early birds, highlight the diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous. There is little evidence, however, to support a Mesozoic origin of modern avian groups. Controversy and debate, nevertheless, surround many of these findings, and more details are needed to give a better appreciation of the significance of these new discoveries.},

  Abstract                 = {The grounding problem is, generally speaking, the problem of how to embed an artificial agent into its environment such that its behaviour, as well as the mechanisms, representations, etc. underlying it, can be intrinsic and meaningful to the agent itself, rather than dependent on an external designer or observer. This paper briefly reviews Searle's and Harnad's analyses of the grounding problem, and then evaluates cognitivist and enactive approaches to overcoming it. It is argued that, although these two categories of approaches differ in their nature and the problems they have to face, both, so far, fall short of solving the grounding problem for similar reasons. Further it is concluded that the reason the problem is still somewhat underestimated lies in the fact that modern situated and embodied AI, despite its emphasis of agent-environment interaction, still fails to fully acknowledge the historically rooted integrated nature of living organisms and their environmental embedding.},

Empirical research into the cognitive processes involved when people view events and talk about them is still a young field. The chapters by leading experts draw on data from the description of events in spoken and signed languages, first and second language acquisition, co-speech gesture and eye movements during language production, and from non-linguistic categorization and other tasks. The book highlights newly found evidence for how perception, thought, and language constrain each other in the experience of events. It will be of particular interest to linguists, psychologists, and philosophers, as well as to anyone interested in the representation and processing of events.

  Abstract                 = {[volume 1]
The study of grammaticalization raises a number of fundamental theoretical issues pertaining to the relation of langue and parole, creativity and automatic coding, synchrony and diachrony, categoriality and continua, typological characteristics and language-specific forms, etc., and therefore challenges some of the basic tenets of twentieth century linguistics. 

This two-volume work presents a number of diverse theoretical viewpoints on grammaticalization and gives insights into the genesis, development, and organization of grammatical categories in a number of language world-wide, with particular attention to morphosyntactic and semantic-pragmatic issues. 

The papers in Volume I are divided into two sections, the first concerned with general method, and the second with issues of directionality. Those in Volume II are divided into five sections: verbal structure, argument structure, subordination, modality, and multiple paths of grammaticalization.
