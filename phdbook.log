Class scrbook Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrbook)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrbook)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrbook)              has been replaced by more several more flexible
(scrbook)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrbook)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrbook)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrbook)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrbook)              features and been removed from others.
(scrbook)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrbook)              avoid this warning, if you are using a

Class scrbook Warning: Usage of deprecated font command `\tt'!
(scrbook)              You should note, that in 1994 font command `\tt' has
(scrbook)              been defined for compatiblitiy to Script 2.0 only.
(scrbook)              Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, you
(scrbook)              shouldn't use such commands any longer and within
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script usage of `\tt' is definitely deprecated.
(scrbook)              See `fntguide.pdf' for more information about
(scrbook)              recommended font commands.
(scrbook)              Note also, that KOMA-Script will remove the definition
(scrbook)              of `\tt' anytime until release of about version 3.20.
(scrbook)              But for now, KOMA-Script will replace deprecated `\tt'
(scrbook)              by `\normalfont \ttfamily ' on input line 148.
